# IRIS: Future Scope & Roadmap

## 1. Integration with Government Data Frameworks
*   **MCA & GSTN API Integration**: Move beyond simulating data to pulling live corporate filings from the Ministry of Corporate Affairs (MCA) and tax data from GSTN. This will enable real-time detection of tax evasion and shell company registration.
*   **Account Aggregator (AA) Framework**: Direct consent-based access to bank statement data for more granular cash-flow analysis.

## 2. Predictive "Time-Travel" Analytics
*   **Bankruptcy Prediction 2.0**: Implement time-series deep learning (LSTMs/Transformers) to predict Z-Scores 12-24 months into the future.
*   **Scenario War Room**: A "Digital Twin" simulation where auditors can test variables (e.g., "What if sales drop 20%?") to stress-test a company's financial resilience.

## 3. Autonomous "Watchdog" Mode
*   **Continuous Surveillance**: Switch agents from "On-Demand" to "Always-On." The system will silently monitor a portfolio of 500+ companies and only wake the user with a "Red Flag Report" when a risk threshold is breached.
*   **News-Driven Triggers**: Automatically re-run forensic audits whenever significant negative news hits the wire.

## 4. Blockchain & Crypto Forensics
*   **Crypto-Asset Tracking**: As shell companies increasingly move funds via cryptocurrency, integrate blockchain analytics to trace off-book transactions and crypto-layering.

## 5. Auditor Copilot & Report Generation
*   **Automated DAR (Draft Audit Report)**: Generate near-complete regulatory filings (e.g., CARO reports) ready for human sign-off, saving 100s of man-hours.
*   **Multi-Lingual RAG**: Enable the QA Agent to process and answer questions in regional Indian languages to democratize financial intelligence.

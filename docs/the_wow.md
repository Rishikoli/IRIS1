# IRIS: The X-Factor (The WOW)

## 1. The "God-Mode" Visualization
*   **The Experience**: Imagine seeing a company not as a static balance sheet, but as a living, breathing organism connected to a hidden web.
*   **The WOW Moment**: Users watch the **Shell Hunter Graph** explode in real-time, revealing invisible strings connecting a reputable firm to shifty offshore shell companies. It’s like turning on a UV light in a dark room.

## 2. The "Council of Agents"
*   **The Experience**: You're not talking to a chatbot; you're commanding an expert squad.
*   **The WOW Moment**: You see the "Market Sentinel" agent flag a negative news story, which *automatically* triggers the "Forensic Auditor" agent to re-calculate the Z-Score, and the "Risk Judge" to downgrade the credit rating. It feels alive.

## 3. Forensic Time-Travel
*   **The Experience**: Seeing the future before it happens.
*   **The WOW Moment**: IRIS doesn't just tell you a company failed; it shows you the **exact moment 12 months ago** when the fraud began (e.g., "M-Score spiked here").

## 4. White-Box Trust
*   **The Experience**: An AI that explains itself.
*   **The WOW Moment**: Instead of a black-box "High Risk" label, IRIS says: *"I flagged this because Net Profit rose 50% while Cash Flow dropped 20%—a classic sign of fictitious revenue."* This builds instant trust with auditors.

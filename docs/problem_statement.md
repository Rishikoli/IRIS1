# Project IRIS: Problem Statement & Solution Overview

## 1. The Core Problem
**Financial Fraud & Systemic Risk Opacity**

In the modern financial landscape, detecting corporate fraud and assessed risk is becoming increasingly difficult due to:

*   **Complexity of Financial Networks**: Fraudsters use intricate webs of shell companies, circular trading loops, and related party transactions (RPTs) to obscure money trails.
*   **Volume of Data**: The sheer amount of financial data (filings, news, market movements) makes manual forensic auditing slow, reactive, and prone to human error.
*   **Sophisticated Manipulation**: Techniques like "window dressing" financial statements or subtly manipulating revenue figures often pass standard checks.
*   **Siloed Analysis**: Traditional tools often look at one aspect (e.g., only ratios or only news) in isolation, missing the holistic picture that reveals the true risk.

**The Consequence**: Investors, auditors, and regulators often discover fraud only *after* a catastrophic collapse (e.g., Enron, Satyam, FTX), resulting in massive financial losses.

## 2. The Solution: IRIS (Investigative Risk Intelligence System)

IRIS is an **Autonomic Multi-Agent AI System** designed to proactively hunt for financial anomalies, visualizing hidden risks before they materialize.

### Key Capabilities

1.  **Forensic Deep-Dives**:
    *   Automated calculation of advanced forensic metrics: **Altman Z-Score** (Bankruptcy risk), **Beneish M-Score** (Earnings manipulation), and **Benford's Law** (Data fabrication).
    *   **Vertical & Horizontal Analysis** of financial statements to detect structural anomalies over time.

2.  **Network Graph Intelligence (The "Shell Hunter")**:
    *   Visualizes **Related Party Transactions (RPT)** to expose hidden connections.
    *   Uses graph algorithms to detect **Circular Trading cycles** and **Interlocking Directorates** (masterminds sitting on multiple shell company boards).

3.  **Multi-Agent Architecture**:
    *   **Agent 7 (QA RAG)**: Answers complex financial queries using a knowledge base of documents.
    *   **Agent 9 (Network Analysis)**: Maps the "Shadow Economy" of shell entities.
    *   **Agent 8 (Market Sentiment)**: Correlates financial data with market news and sentiment.
    *   **Agent 3 (Risk Scoring)**: Aggregates findings into a single, explainable **Risk Score**.

4.  **Real-Time & Explainable**:
    *   Provides **Risk Explainability (SHAP)** to tell users *why* a company is flagged high-risk.
    *   Interactive dashboards for real-time investigation and "What-If" scenario planning.

## 3. Impact
IRIS shifts financial surveillance from **reactive auditing** to **proactive intelligence**, enabling stakeholders to "see the invisible" risks in corporate structures and financial statements.

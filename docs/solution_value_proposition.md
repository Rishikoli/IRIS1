# IRIS: Solution & Value Proposition (Summary)

## The Solution
**An Autonomic Digital Forensic Squad**
IRIS replaces siloed, manual auditing with a multi-agent AI system that fuses:
1.  **Quantitative Analysis**: Automated 29+ forensic metrics (Z-Score, Beneish M-Score).
2.  **Network Intelligence**: A "Shell Hunter" graph that visualizes hidden money laundering loops.
3.  **Qualitative Insights**: Sentiment analysis of news and unstructured text.

**The "Council of Agents"**
Instead of one model, IRIS employs specialized agents (Analyst, Detective, Judge) powered by **Gemini 2.5 Flash** to reason independently and collaborate on a final verdict.

## The Value Proposition

*   **⚡ Speed**: Reduces analysis time from **weeks to seconds**. Screen 100s of companies daily.
*   **👁️ Visibility**: Reveals the **"Shadow Economy"** (shell companies, circular trading) that spreadsheets miss.
*   **✅ Truth**: Explains *why* a company is risky (SHAP values), shifting from "Black Box" scores to **trusted intelligence**.
*   **💰 ROI**: Transforms compliance from a cost center into a **strategic value driver** by preventing bad investments.

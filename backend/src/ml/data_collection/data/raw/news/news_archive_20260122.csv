Ahead of Market: 10 things that will decide stock market action on Thursday,"The Indian market ended lower for a third consecutive session on Wednesday, deepening a sharp market rout that has erased nearly Rs 14 lakh crore in investor wealth. The selloff, driven by global jitters and uneven corporate earnings, pushed the benchmark Sensex down more than 1,660 points over three sessions, while the Nifty 50 slipped about 2%.At the end of the session, the BSE Sensex had trimmed losses to end down 271 points, or 0.33%, at 81,909.63.

Sebi's rap on the knuckles: Investment adviser pulled up for routing client money through employee account,"Market regulator Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) has reprimanded an investment advisor for multiple violations of the Investment Advisers regulations, including routing client funds through the personal bank account of an employee.In a 16-page order, Sebi directedWinway Research's proprietorAnkur Jainto be diligent and careful in his dealings as an Investment Adviser. The regulator found Jain charging fees for the same product for overlapping durations; receiving money from the client in the personal bank account of his employee; failure to maintain call records and to submit call records to Sebi and non-resolution ofSCORES complaints.The order was passed after an enquiry report was submitted to the regulator on November 18, 2024, following certain complaints against Jain on the SCORES portal. Sebi conducted an examination of the complaints to ascertain if the applicable regulatory compliances were being followed by the accused.In his defence, Jain told SEBI that his firm does not accept client fees in any third-party bank accounts, a policy clearly stated in its agreements, invoices, and on its website. He denied allegations of funds being routed to employees’ personal accounts, claiming that certain former employees misused company credentials to carry out unauthorised activities without the firm’s knowledge.Jain argued that the firm cannot be held responsible for the independent actions of ex-employees, citing the absence of vicarious liability, and said SEBI had already been informed about individuals issuing fake invoices using the firm’s name.Live EventsOn charging fees for overlapping periods, Jain said that the allegation that a client was sold services for overlapping periods was due to lack of understanding of the invoicing system before the amendment of 2020 as at that point, a combined bill was raised for all the services.

"Watch out! Gold, silver on MCX, ETFs trading at premium to international rates","Precious metals gold and silver are trading at abnormally high premiums over international benchmarks in India as traders, whether on MCX or those dealing in ETFs, are acting on rumours around the possibility of a potential customs duty hike in the upcoming Union Budget to be presented in the Parliament on February 1.The premium spike, exceeding Rs 30,000 per kg for silver and 3-4% for gold, marks a sharp departure from the typical minimal spread between Multi Commodity Exchange (MCX) and COMEX prices, signaling widespread market anxiety about possible policy action.""The premium in the Indian market is abnormally high this time because the market is expecting there may be a duty hike in the Budget. That's why the premium is increasing,"" Manoj Kumar Jain, Director and Head of Commodity and Currency Research atPrithviFinmart told ET.The surge comes against the backdrop of dramatic price movements, with MCX gold February futures trading around 5% higher at Rs 1,57,750 by 5 pm, while silver March futures jumped 3% to Rs 3,33,672. Gold ETFs showed even sharper gains—Gold BeES ETF shot up 7.6%, Zerodha Gold ETF soared 9.6% higher, and Nippon India Silver ETF climbed 4.8%.The abnormal premium is creating technical dislocations in arbitrage trades. ""International traders also do arbitrage between COMEX and MCX. Normally international traders are long on COMEX, short on MCX. Now as the price is going up, the spread is increasing and they are incurring losses. So there is a technical reason as well for this premium,"" Jain explained.Live EventsThe speculation centers on whether the government might roll back its July 2024 decision to slash customs duty on gold and silver from 15% to 6%, a move initially designed to support the gems and jewellery sector and curb smuggling.""Now rising gold prices are directly impacting rupee depreciation.

"Union Budget FY27: These 6 calls could end the fiscal drag, Nuvama says","India’s economy may be bottoming out, but without fresh policy support the recovery risks losing steam. In its FY27 Budget preview,Nuvama Institutional Equitieslays out six expectations that frame how Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman could try to revive growth, without blowing a hole in the fiscal math. From halting fiscal consolidation and lifting capex to betting on disinvestment, deregulation and targeted sector pushes, the brokerage argues that FY27 could mark the end of years of fiscal drag.The Union Budget is likely to mark a turning point from years of fiscal tightening, but the shift may not be strong enough to change market positioning meaningfully, according to Nuvama Institutional Equities. While higher development spending and capex are welcome, the brokerage said they may still fall short of arresting the ongoingearnings downgrade cycle, as margins are poised for mean reversion and external headwinds remain. As a result, Nuvama continues to maintain a defensive bias, preferring telecom, internet, IT, consumer, cement and chemicals, while staying underweight on BFSI, autos, industrials and power.The brokerage said the economy is “bottoming out”, but growth impulses remain weak despite last year’s tax cuts, making complementary fiscal support critical as global uncertainties linger. Nuvama expects the Centre to retain the gross fiscal deficit (GFD) target at 4.4% of GDP in FY27, unchanged from FY26, thereby ending the negative fiscal impulse of recent years, even as it cautioned that a modest fiscal push may not be sufficient to drive a sharp top-line recovery for India Inc.1) Fiscal consolidation pausesNuvama expects the finance minister to “abstain from further fiscal consolidation” in FY27, keeping the GFD at 4.4% of GDP. With five years of tightening behind it, the brokerage says fiscal drag should fade, turning the fiscal impulse neutral from negative.

"Jio valuation may jump to $190 billion by 2028, says CLSA, raises RIL target price to Rs 1,800","Jio Platforms’ enterprise valuation (EV) could climb to about $190 billion by March 2028, with CLSA arguing that the planned listing of theRelianceunit could create one of the world’s top 10 telecom stocks and drive upside in Reliance Industries’ share price. The brokerage has raised its 12‑month target price onReliance Industriesto Rs 1,800 from Rs 1,650 while reiterating an “Outperform” rating, even after trimming valuation multiples for the group’s retail and new energy businesses.CLSA forecasts Jio’s enterprise value at $161 billion by March 2027, rising to $190 billion a year later, assigning the business a 15% valuation premium to the average free‑cash‑flow yield of global telecom peers excluding China.“Using a 12‑month forward FCF yield of 4.6%, our Jio base case is for Mar 2027/Mar 2028CL EVs of US$161bn/US$190bn,” the brokerage said, adding that Jio’s IPO “could position it amongst world’s most valuable telecom players.”Reliance is targeting a Jio listing by mid‑2026, which CLSA calls “the key event” for the conglomerate this year.The note argues that free‑cash‑flow yield, rather than Ebitda or reported Arpu, is the most appropriate yardstick to benchmark Jio against global telcos, citing divergent accounting for spectrum and licences as well as Reliance’s strategy of front‑loading capex and capitalising opex. On its forecasts, Jio’s free cash flow is expected to jump from $1.7 billion in FY25 to $7.4 billion in FY28 and $8.7 billion in FY29 as 5G investment tapers off and cash generation accelerates. “With most 5G capex front‑loaded, Jio is expected [to] achieve significant free cash flow over the coming years,” CLSA said.Live EventsThe brokerage justifies the premium multiple by flagging four growth levers: monetisation of Jio’s in‑house 5G stack and UBR technology by partnering with other operators, a large under‑penetrated broadband opportunity, scope to lift Arpu by upgrading users to 5G, and the ability to monetise one of the highest customer‑engageme",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/jio-valuation-may-jump-to-190-billion-by-2028-says-clsa-raises-ril-target-price-to-rs-1800/articleshow/126973813.cms,economictimes,2026-01-22,neutral

‘Pray that stocks don’t fall’: Nithin Kamath warns Rs 1.1 lakh crore margin trading boom has worrying risks,"Zerodhafounder and CEONithin Kamathhas flagged what he calls a “structural risk” building up in India’sequitymarkets, warning that the rapid growth of themargin tradingfacility (MTF) could amplify market stress during the next sharp correction.In a detailed post on X, Kamath said MTF, a mechanism that allows investors to buy shares by borrowing from their broker against a margin, has expanded nearly five-fold over the last four years to more than Rs 1.10 lakh crore.He noted that this growth has accelerated particularly after higher margins andsecurities transaction tax(STT) were imposed on derivatives trading, pushing leveraged activity into the cash market instead.MTF, or margin trading facility, allows investors to purchase shares by paying only a portion of the total value upfront, typically 20 to 25%, with the broker funding the rest. Regulations permit leverage of up to five times on approved stocks.Unlike derivatives, where positions are marked to market daily and typically short-term, MTF positions can be held for months, making risk accumulation slower but potentially more severe.Live EventsKamath’s concern is not the existence of MTF itself, but the absence of a robust, system-wide risk model governing how it is offered and managed. According to him, competition among brokers has led to a “race to the bottom”, where almost every firm offers the maximum leverage allowed by regulation. Any broker that takes a more conservative stance risks losing market share. This, he argued, leaves little room for differentiated risk management.He highlighted that MTF carries multiple risk multipliers compared with futures and options. Clients tend to hold positions for much longer periods, leverage is available across nearly 1,300 stocks including many illiquid names, and positions are overwhelmingly on the buy side.

Midcap Meltdown: 14 stocks crash up to 50% in just 3 months. Is your portfolio at risk?,"Over the last three months, the Indian equity market has shifted decisively. The Sensex slipped 2.5%, but the real damage lies below the surface. The BSE Midcap Index fell nearly 4%, yet that headline masks a much deeper churn: 103 of 144 midcap stocks delivered negative returns, meaning over two-thirds of the space has been under pressure.The intensity of the correction is stark.

"From bloodbath to bounce: Sensex erases 1,000 point shock, Nifty above 25,250 as bargain hunters step in","After wiping out nearly Rs 6 lakh crore in investor wealth and plunging more than 1,000 points earlier in the day, Indian equities clawed their way back on Wednesday, staging a sharp midday rebound as bargain hunters moved into beaten-down heavyweight stocks, though market veterans warned the recovery may be more reflex than revival.By around 1:00 PM, the BSE Sensex had swung back into positive territory, rising 170 points, or 0.2%, to an intraday high of 82,350.34, after sliding as much as 1,056 points to 81,124.45 earlier in the session. The Nifty 50 followed suit, climbing 68 points, or 0.3%, to an intraday high of 25,300.95, recovering from a low of 24,919.80 that briefly dragged the index below the psychologically important 25,000 level.The rebound came after a bruising morning selloff that extended losses into a third straight session, driven by a toxic mix of global risk aversion, persistent foreign fund outflows, a sliding rupee and patchy domestic earnings. At its worst, the fall erased about Rs 6 lakh crore in market capitalisation, underscoring the fragility of investor sentiment.Market participants attributed the turnaround largely to selective buying in quality names after the recent correction, rather than any meaningful shift in the broader risk environment.“It seems like bargain hunting in the quality stocks after the recent decline, but participants shouldn't read much into this and wait for the closing and sustainability of the long term moving average i.e. 200 DEMA i.e. around 25,150, for clarity,” said Ajit Mishra, SVP, Research at Religare Broking.Live Events""The market was falling for last few days due to rising geopolitical tensions, which was exacerbated by Trump's Greenland bid and today’s drawdown appears to have been primarily driven by margin calls impacting highly leveraged positions, which accelerated forced unwinding across the market,"" said Sunny Agrawal, Head of Fundamental Research at SBI Securities, adding that once those positions",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/from-bloodbath-to-bounce-sensex-erases-1000-point-shock-nifty-above-25250-as-bargain-hunters-step-in/articleshow/126951532.cms,economictimes,2026-01-22,neutral
Eternal shares soar 6% ahead of Q3 results today. Here’s what to expect,"Shares ofEternal, previouslyZomato, rallied as much as 6.2% to their day’s high of Rs 287 on the BSE on Wednesday, ahead of its third quarter earnings scheduled for later today. The stock was the top gainer on the 50-share Nifty in the afternoon.Eternal is expected to post strong headline growth in the December quarter, largely driven by the transition of Blinkit to a first-party (1P) model and the continued expansion of its quick commerce business. On average, five brokerages estimate consolidated revenue to rise 193% year-on-year in Q3, while profit after tax is expected to increase 51% from a year ago.However, analysts caution that margin trends and losses in Blinkit and other newer businesses will remain key monitorables, even as the core food delivery segment continues to show gradual improvement.Food delivery growth in Q3 is expected to be steady, but slightly slower than in previous quarters. Nuvama estimates food delivery net order value to grow 2.2% quarter-on-quarter and 14.1% year-on-year, indicating stable demand but limited acceleration.Domestic brokerage Motilal Oswal expects food delivery order value to rise around 12% year-on-year, with take rates holding at approximately 21.5%. Kotak Equities, meanwhile, projects food delivery gross merchandise value (GMV) growth of 18% year-on-year. On the profitability front, brokerages anticipate incremental margin improvement. Nuvama pegs adjusted EBITDA margin as a percentage of net order value at around 5.4%, while Motilal Oswal expects a sequential improvement of 20 basis points to 5.5%. Kotak Equities models a lower food delivery EBITDA margin of 4.5%, though still improving sequentially.Live EventsBlinkit, the company's quick commerce arm, is expected to be the key growth driver in Q3.

"Kalyan Jewellers shares tank 14%, fall for 9th consecutive session. Should investors exit?","Shares ofKalyan Jewellerstumbled as much as 14% to their day’s low of Rs 390 on the BSE on Wednesday, continuing its bearish run on Dalal Street for a 9th consecutive session. With today’s fall, the counter is down 25% over the same period. In the first 14 sessions in 2026, the stock has ended in the green only three times.The bearish run coincides with gold prices surging to fresh record highs of nearly Rs 1.6 lakh per 10 grams. When gold prices rise sharply, jewellery becomes more expensive, leading to postponement of purchases. Mass and mid-market consumers tend to cut back, causing a decline in volume growth, particularly for plain gold jewellery.While volumes may soften, revenues can still grow because of higher gold prices. However, this growth is price-led rather than demand-led. For jewellery makers, this often results in higher ticket sizes but fewer units sold.Last week, the company appointed Radhika Ramani and C.R. Rajagopal as Additional Directors in the capacity of Non-Executive and Independent Directors. Both appointments are for a term of five consecutive years. The board said the appointments are in line with the company’s ongoing focus on strengthening corporate governance, enhancing independent oversight and driving long-term value creation.Technical view“On the daily chart, price has broken decisively below all key moving averages (20, 50, 100 & 200 EMA), confirming a well-established downtrend.

India EU trade deal closer than ever: Jefferies lists 4 sectoral winners for stock market investors,"India’s long pending free trade agreement (FTA) with the European Union is around the corner, with Jefferies saying the proposed deal could materially alter sectoral dynamics for Indian exporters, especially in textiles, autos, electronics and pharma chemicals, while politically sensitive agri and dairy are likely to be kept out.Talks that began in 2007 and stalled in 2013 have seen renewed momentum since 2022, and Jefferies notes that broad agreement on avoiding sensitive items such as agriculture on both sides seems to be culminating in the FTA in the coming few days. The brokerage points out that India’s annual goods trade with the EU is about US$130 billion, similar in size to that with China or the US, with exports to the bloc at an annualised US$75 billion, accounting for 17% of India’s total exports and roughly 1.9% of GDP.India currently runs a sizeable surplus with the EU, helped by a post Russia Ukraine war surge in petroleum product and electronics exports, with Jefferies estimating the goods trade surplus at US$10 to US$15 billion since 2022. Services trade is also significant at US$72 billion, where India enjoys a US$9 billion surplus.Jefferies flags textiles as one of the biggest potential winners from tariff cuts. The EU imports about US$125 billion of textiles and apparel annually, of which India has just a 5 to 6% share, compared with China at 30% and a combined 20% share for Bangladesh and Pakistan. Crucially, Bangladesh and Pakistan already benefit from zero tariffs in the EU, versus duties of up to 10% faced by Indian exporters.“The FTA bringing Indian textile duties on par with its South Asian neighbours will be a key positive,” Jefferies writes in a report, adding that this comes at a time when the US tariff imposition of 50% has significantly hurt the sector’s competitiveness in that market.Live EventsOn autos, Jefferies underlines that a key European ask is better access to India’s passenger vehicle market, where import tariffscurrently go as",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/india-eu-trade-deal-closer-than-ever-jefferies-lists-4-sectoral-winners-for-stock-market-investors/articleshow/126938736.cms,economictimes,2026-01-22,neutral

The sharp rebound followed a three day losing streak.The recent decline was triggered by comments from company executives stating that MRPL, a state run oil refiner and fuel retailer, is not importing Russian crude due to Western sanctions and is exploring purchases of Venezuelan oil.According to Devendra Kumar, MRPL’s head of finance, the company is considering Venezuelan crude purchases as it halts Russian oil imports to remain compliant with international sanctions. “We are in strict compliance with all sanctions in place, and currently no Russian crude is being imported,” Kumar stated during an analyst call.MRPL operates a 500,000 barrel per day refinery in Karnataka and exports roughly 40% of its refined fuel output.Prior to the recent three day dip, the stock had surged nearly 9% last week following strong Q3 FY26 results. The company reported a net profit of Rs 1,451 crore, nearly five times the Rs 309 crore recorded in the same quarter last year.

"Rs 14 lakh crore gone in 3 days! Sensex sheds 1,660 points, Nifty falls 2%. Here are 5 key factors behind the stock market fall","Indian equities closed lower for a third consecutive session on Wednesday, deepening a sharp market rout that has erased nearly Rs 14 lakh crore in investor wealth. The selloff, driven by global jitters and uneven corporate earnings, pushed the benchmark Sensex down more than 1,660 points over three sessions, while theNifty50 slipped about 2%.The Sensex slid as much as 1,056 points intraday to a low of 81,124.45 on Wednesday, and the Nifty fell 1.2% to touch 24,919.80, as risk appetite weakened and selling pressure intensified across sectors. At its worst, the market had wiped out close to ₹6 lakh crore in a single session.Stocks later pared losses, staging a sharp rebound around midday as bargain hunters stepped into battered heavyweight names. Market participants, however, cautioned that the recovery appeared tactical rather than a sign of a durable turnaround.By the close, the BSE Sensex had trimmed losses to end down 271 points, or 0.33%, at 81,909.63. The Nifty 50 fell 75 points, or 0.30%, to settle at 25,157.50.The three-day decline has shaved about Rs 13.68 lakh crore off total market capitalisation, pulling the value of all BSE-listed companies down to Rs 454.15 lakh crore.Live EventsDharmesh Shah of ICICI Securities noted that buying interest emerged from oversold levels, with supportive demand seen below the 200-day EMA coinciding with the lower band of the rising channel drawn from the August–September 2025 lows.""Going ahead, sustaining above today’s low will be crucial to maintain the recovery bias, while a decisive move above the previous session’s high would signal follow-through strength and open the path for technical pullback towards the 25,600 zone,"" said Shah.Market breadth is always a good indicator to understand the sentiment of the market, Shah said, adding that ""Historically it has been observed that whenever the net of advance-decline of total CNX500 has approached the level of 440-470, it is a sign of capitulation and market has a tendency t",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/why-is-stock-market-falling-today-rs-3-lakh-crore-gone-sensex-cracks-over-700-points-nifty-below-25100-5-key-factors-behind-the-stock-market-fall-today/articleshow/126933526.cms,economictimes,2026-01-22,neutral

RIL shares are also on track to record the worst start to a year since 2011.Following the Q3 results, most analysts have cut their consolidated estimates on the stock by 1-3%, largely driven by cuts in the retail segment.Out of the 28 brokerages which have a coverage on the stock, the median price target stood at Rs 1,717, which signals 23% upside potential from current market prices.

Warren Buffett's successor eyes selling off Berkshire Hathaway's 325 million Kraft Heinz shares,"Warren Buffett's successor appears to be considering his first significant move after taking over as CEO this month.Kraft Heinzwarned investors Tuesday thatBerkshire Hathawaymay be interested in selling its 325 million shares in the name brand food giant that Buffett helped create back in 2015. The news came in a filing with stock market regulators.Buffett and the Brazilian investment firm 3G Capital orchestrated the merger of Kraft and Heinz back then because they already owned Heinz and believed in the power of their brands. NowGreg Abelmay be plotting a different course.Over the years since Buffett had come to realize that the company's competitive moat around its brands wasn't as strong as he thought as consumers have increasingly been willing to switch to store brands and move away from processed foods.

Buffett said last fall that he was disappointed in Kraft Heinz' plan to split the company in two, and Berkshire's two representatives resigned from the Kraft board last spring.But still it was rare for Buffett to unload an acquisition during his six decades leading Berkshire even when he soured on a business' prospects.

A Bloomberg gauge of the dollar was a touch lower Wednesday.The moves underscored mounting investor unease over erratic US foreign policy, with global funds pulling back from American assets.

Nomura sued by Adani-linked fund accused in short-seller Hindenburg report,"Nomura Holdings Inc.’s loans to an investment fund embroiled in a short-selling firm’s allegations against Indian billionaire Gautam Adani have come under scrutiny in a London lawsuit.Some three years after Adani first faced questions about fraud and stock manipulation at his ports-to-power conglomerate, Tokyo-based Nomura was sued by a fund owned by Elara Capital Plc over an urgent cash demand that allegedly cost it tens of millions of dollars.The Elara fund, known asOyster Bay FundLtd., borrowed from Nomura for stock bets onAdani Enterprises Ltd. andAdani Ports& Special Economic Zone Ltd., according to High Court filings from the case. Shares in those companies plunged after a January 2023 report by Hindenburg Research accused Adani’s empire of “brazen stock manipulation” and alleged Elara was involved.Some of Nomura’s most senior bankers in Asia were spooked and wanted to cut the size of the loans, according to the bank’s defense filed Jan. 5. The Elara fund claimed that the bank requested $205 million in cash to recoup the debts but then breached a repayment plan by selling Adani shares that had been pledged as collateral — a move that resulted in losses of $43 million. The Tokyo-based lender has denied any wrongdoing.The case is part of the fallout from Hindenburg’s almost 100-page report on Adani, which at one point eroded more than $150 billion of value from his Adani Group’s publicly-traded entities and triggered local regulatory probes — including one involving Elara. Asia’s second-richest man rejected the report as “baseless” and “nothing short of a calculated securities fraud.”Live EventsThe filings also show how Nomura dealt with loans to its high-risk trading clients in 2023, two years after losing almost $3 billion on similar trades with Archegos Capital Management.Within days of theHindenburg report, a group of Nomura’s top Asian officials including head of equity-product sales Ajay Jain, Asia markets sales co-heads Corrinne Teo and Charles Myong and ",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/nomura-sued-by-adani-linked-fund-accused-in-short-seller-report/articleshow/126799315.cms,economictimes,2026-01-22,neutral

IEX shares fall over 4% ahead of APTEL hearing on market coupling,"Shares ofIndian Energy Exchange(IEX) fell 4% on Tuesday to a low of Rs 131.34 on the NSE, as investors turned cautious amid ongoing hearings on themarket coupling issuebefore the Appellate Tribunal for Electricity (APTEL).The case is expected to come for a hearing today around 2:15 PM, a CNBC-TV18 report said.IEX shares today extended their Monday decline, falling nearly 6% in two sessions. The price action was accompanied by high volumes as nearly a crore shares changed hands on the NSE around 1:30 PM.According to the CNBC-TV18 report, the counsel for the Central Electricity Regulatory Commission (CERC), on Monday, told the APTEL bench that the regulator will not implement market coupling till proper regulations are in place.Meanwhile, Power Minister Manohar Lal Khattar had also indicated that the government's stance on market coupling remains unchanged, the report added.Live EventsIn the previous hearings, the electricity regulator’s counsel had sought time from APTEL to obtain instructions from the CERC on withdrawing the market coupling order.The bench had then noted that it would be incorrect to assume that the 2025 ruling, norms, or orders will automatically continue, indicating that the previous directive may not be upheld.Meanwhile, the CERC had issued a fresh clarification on its July 2025 market coupling order, saying that the order should be read as “directions,” - a move that appears to have heightened investor caution.CERC's July 23, 2025, order introduced a market coupling mechanism - a structural reform that could potentially alter how electricity prices are discovered across power exchanges. The market sees this move as diluting the company’s dominance in price discovery, liquidity, and trading volumes.IEX share price performanceThe stock has fallen over 30% since theCERC orderwas passed, and is currently trading below its 50-day and 200-day simple moving averages (SMAs) of Rs 140.6 and Rs 161.4, respectively, according to Trendlyne data.(Disclaimer:",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/iex-shares-fall-over-4-ahead-of-aptel-hearing-on-market-coupling/articleshow/126777087.cms,economictimes,2026-01-22,neutral
"LG Electronics India shares can rally another 20%, says JM Financial after initiating coverage with Buy. Check target price","Shares ofLG Electronics Indiacan surge 20% from current market levels, according to domestic brokerage firmJM Financial, after it initiated coverage on the stock with a Buy rating and a target price of Rs 1,630 per share.Among India’s leading home appliances brands, the company retained pole position in the offline channel across categories, including refrigerators, ACs, washing machines and televisions. This dominance, JM believes, is driven by its robust brand recall, edge in technology and innovation, strong parentage and widespread distribution.Further, the company’s close integration with its Korean parent, LG Electronics, remains a key differentiator and a critical factor in helping the company stay ahead of the competition. The partnership spans product innovation and design, with LG India’s own R&D spending at around 0.4% of revenue, complemented by the parent company’s significantly higher annual R&D investment of roughly $2 billion, or 3–4% of its revenue. This collaboration supports faster innovation cycles and helps the company consistently refresh its product portfolio. In addition, LGEIL benefits from access to advanced manufacturing technologies and technical know-how, as well as allocation of global exports.The company’s extensive in-house manufacturing footprint, with nearly 95% of products manufactured internally at its Noida and Pune facilities, gives the company strong control over its supply chain while delivering meaningful scale efficiencies. Further strengthening this advantage, it has announced plans to set up a third manufacturing facility at Sri City in Andhra Pradesh, with a proposed investment of Rs 5,000 crore. The new unit, expected to become operational by FY27E, will initially focus on air conditioners and AC compressors, before expanding into washing machines and refrigerators. Once fully ramped up, the facility is expected to nearly double capacity across key segments and triple AC compressor capacity, reinforcing LGEIL’s long-term",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/lg-electronics-india-shares-can-rally-another-20-says-jm-financial-after-initiating-coverage-with-buy-check-target-price/articleshow/126776698.cms,economictimes,2026-01-22,neutral

Eternal Q3 Preview: Earnings set to grow 50% YoY; Blinkit losses persist,"Eternalis expected to post robust headline growth in the December quarter, largely supported byBlinkit’s transition to a first-party (1P) model and continued momentum in quick commerce. On average, five brokerages project consolidated revenue to surge 193% year-on-year in Q3, while profit after tax is estimated to rise 51% from the same period last year.Meanwhile, analysts caution that margin performance and ongoing losses in Blinkit and other newer businesses will remain key monitorables, even as the core food delivery segment shows steady signs of improvement.Food delivery: Growth moderates, margins inch upThe food delivery business is likely to record steady growth in Q3, albeit at a slower pace than in previous quarters. Nuvama estimates net order value for food delivery to rise 2.2% quarter-on-quarter and 14.1% year-on-year, indicating stable demand but limited acceleration.Motilal Oswal expects order value for food delivery to grow around 12% year-on-year, with take rates holding at about 21.5%.

Dr Reddy's Q3 preview: PAT may fall 22% YoY as US pressure to weigh on earnings,"Dr Reddy's Laboratoriesis expected to report a muted performance in the December quarter, with pressure from the US business offsetting steady growth in India and Europe. On average, five brokerages expect consolidated revenue to decline about 1% year on year in Q3, while profit after tax is seen falling 22% from a year ago, reflecting a lower contribution from gRevlimid and margin compression.North America: Revlimid drag dominatesThe US business is expected to remain the key drag on overall performance. Axis Securities expects US sales of around $310 million, with gRevlimid limits resulting in a negligible contribution during the quarter. Kotak Equities models slightly higher North America sales of $325 million, but still estimates a sharp 13% quarter-on-quarter decline due to pricing pressure and erosion in the base business.Motilal Oswal is more cautious, projecting a 21.6% year-on-year decline in North America sales to about $310 million, led by intensified pricing pressure on gRevlimid. YES Securities also notes that Revlimid will no longer be a meaningful contributor after more than two years of sales, exposing the underlying growth trajectory of the US base portfolio.Brokerages broadly agree that the absence of Revlimid will continue to weigh on growth, keeping the US business subdued in the near term.Live EventsIndia: A relative bright spotIndia is expected to remain the strongest contributor to growth in Q3.

"Bajaj Electricals shares surge 11%, competitor stocks tumble up to 5%. What’s happening?","Shares ofBajaj Electricals Ltd. surged sharply on Tuesday, January 20, rising as much as 11% to an intraday high of Rs 468, after the company announced its foray into the wires segment, a move aimed at expanding and diversifying its business operations amid rising demand in the category.The company said the wires business will be introduced as a new product line under its Lighting Solutions segment, signalling a strategic expansion within an existing vertical.Bajaj Electricalshighlighted that demand in the wires industry has been on the rise and that the entry is expected to contribute meaningfully to sustainable long-term growth.In a regulatory filing, Bajaj Electricals clarified that it plans to launch the new wire products shortly, after which it will closely monitor market response to determine the scale of investments required. The company noted that the eventual investment outlay will be guided by several factors, including the size of the opportunity, operational requirements, and prevailing external conditions.Currently, the Lighting Solutions segment operates at margins of around 10%, which are broadly in line with margins seen across the cables and wires industry, where peers typically report margins in the 10–12% range.However, the announcement weighed on shares of existing players in the housing wires segment.

Jindal Saw shares rally 20% in two sessions on strong Q3FY26 results,"Jindal SAW sharessurged up to 5% on Tuesday to hit an intraday high of Rs 188.38 on the NSE, buoyed by positive investor sentiment after the company’s strong performance in the December quarter (Q3FY26). The stock extended its rally for a second straight session, climbing nearly 20% over the past two trading days.The sharp rise comes following the company’s reporting a robust sequential improvement in earnings, highlighting a recovery in operational performance.Jindal SAWposted a profit after tax (PAT) of Rs 248 crore in Q3FY26, up sharply from Rs 139 crore in the previous quarter, reflecting a robust 78% sequential (QoQ) growth. However, on a year-on-year basis, PAT fell 48.4% from Rs 479.4 crore in Q3FY25, largely due to a high base effect.Revenue from operations mirrored this trend. It increased 17% sequentially to Rs 4,943 crore in Q3FY26 from Rs 4,234 crore in Q2FY26, but declined 6% year-on-year from Rs 5,271 crore in the same quarter last year.Despite the YoY decline, the company noted that operational performance has steadily improved over the past two quarters, indicating a gradual recovery.Live EventsJindal SAW also reported a robust order book of around US$ 1,481 million for its Iron & Steel Pipes and Pellets segment as of Q3FY26. Of the total, Iron & Steel Pipes account for approximately US$ 1,442 million, while the Pellets segment contributes about US$ 39 million. This strong order backlog provides healthy medium-term revenue visibility and is expected to support the company’s business momentum in the coming quarters.The company also made progress on balance-sheet strengthening. Long-term debt declined on both the standalone and consolidated levels.Consolidated long-term debt stood at Rs 6,890 million in December 2025, down from Rs 7,417 million in September 2025.The strong sequential earnings growth, improving operations, robust order book, and debt reduction have boosted investor confidence, driving the recent surge in Jindal SAW’s share price.

"PNB shares slide 5% in 2 days after Q3 results. Should you buy, sell or hold?","Punjab NationalBank’s shares extended their post-results slide for a second straight session, falling as much as 2% on Tuesday to Rs 125.50 on the BSE, as investors digested margin pressure and a cut in the lender’s net interest margin guidance even as headline profit beat estimates. The stock has declined about 5% over the past two trading sessions since the December-quarter results were announced on Monday.The selloff comes despite the state-run lender reporting a 13% year-on-year rise in December-quarter net profit to Rs 5,100 crore, supported by recoveries, treasury gains and improving asset quality. For the market, however, the sharper focus has been on weakening margins, softer core operating performance and what brokerages see as limited levers to arrest the decline in net interest margins.Citi's viewCiti saidPNB’s net interest margin contracted 8 basis points quarter-on-quarter to 2.52%, below its estimates, prompting the bank to cut its FY26 NIM guidance to 2.6% from an earlier 2.8-2.9%.While return on assets held up at 1.06%, Citi attributed this to treasury gains, recoveries from written-off accounts and tax reversals rather than core operating strength.

"Budget 2026: How India introduced, scrapped and raised capital gains taxes for stock market investors","With just days to go forBudget 2026, calls for tax relief are growing louder in the stock market. The demands this time are more noisy given the persistent foreign investor selling, weak equity returns and rising volatility. Market participants hope that any easing ofequity taxation-- particularlylong-term capital gains-- could help revive foreign inflows and restore confidence.Against this backdrop, here is a revisit of how India has taxed stock market gains over the years, why these taxes were introduced, withdrawn and reintroduced, and where they stand today.Before getting into the policy shifts, capital gains refer to the profit an investor makes when selling an asset such as shares, mutual funds or property at a price higher than the purchase cost. In equities, these gains are classified based on how long the investment is held.If listed shares are sold within one year of purchase, the profit is treated as short-term capital gain (STCG). If they are sold after one year, it is long-term capital gain (LTCG). Losses are classified using the same rules.Early days of stock market - The 90sLive EventsIndia's approach to taxing equity gains has evolved over the past three decades. In the early 1990s, long-term capital gains on equities were taxed at 20%, with indexation benefits available. Indexation is a method that adjusts the buying price of the asset for inflation before calculating capital gains. By raising the cost base, indexation reduces the taxable income and reflects the impact of inflation over time.There was no concept of a tax onshort-term capital gainsback then. This structure broadly continued through the 1990s, but high taxes and complex calculations were often seen as discouraging wider market participation.The 2004 shiftIndia's modern capital gains framework for equities took shape in the early 2000s. In 2004, the government introduced the Securities Transaction Tax (STT) on equity trades. At the same time, it abolished long-termcapital gains taxon l",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/budget-2026-how-india-introduced-scrapped-and-raised-capital-gains-taxes-for-stock-market-investors/articleshow/126763861.cms,economictimes,2026-01-22,neutral

What to do?","HDFC Bankshares continue to underperform despite largely in-line Q3 earnings and positive commentary from leading brokerages. India’s largest private lender has been the worst performer in the Nifty Bank index over the past six months, sliding 6%. While the broader outlook remains constructive, the bank finds itself in a delicate balancing act between loan growth and deposit mobilisation.HDFC Bank’s Q3FY26 earnings show steady undertones, with the lender’s profit after tax (PAT) ahead of Elara’s estimates, while the pre-provisioning operating profit (PPoP) was in line with the brokerage’s estimates.Axis Securities, in its Q3 review, also maintained a buoyant growth outlook for HDFC Bank following its in-line PAT and net interest income (NII), though PPoP was below its estimates.HDFC Bank on Saturday reported an 11% jump in its December quarter standalone net profit at Rs 18,654 crore compared to Rs 16,735 crore reported in the year-ago period. HDFC Bank’s net interest income (NII) for the quarter ended December 31, 2025, grew by 6.4% to Rs 32,620 crore from Rs 30,650 crore for the quarter ended December 31, 2024.

Heavy IPO oversubscription across categories translated into aggressive buying on debut,” she said.Rajan Shinde, Research Analyst at Mehta Equities, said BCCL offers exposure to a strategically critical asset with a dominant position in India’s coking coal value chain. He cited the company’s large reserve base in the Jharia coalfields, leadership in coking coal washery capacity, and strong logistics infrastructure as key competitive advantages. “Backed byCoal India’s technical and financial strength, BCCL is well placed to benefit from structural demand tailwinds and India’s import substitution push.

India’s debt-GDP ratio, still above pre-Covid levels, is targeted to be reduced by about 5 percentage points by FY31, even as tax revenue growth in FY27 is projected at around 8%, marking a third straight year of sub‑10% growth.A key fiscal support will be another strong transfer from the Reserve Bank of India. Jefferies estimates the FY27 RBI dividend could rise 10–15% to about ₹3 trillion, aided by rupee depreciation, helping offset weak tax buoyancy and keep the deficit target within reach.Capex to turn defence heavyOn expenditure, Jefferies expects overall government capital spending to grow about 12% in FY27 to ₹12.5 trillion, but stresses that “the requirement of a reset in defence capex will take priority, which may grow at a much higher 25%.” With year‑to‑date FY26 defence capex already up 57%, the brokerage sees non‑defence capex growth moderating to the 5–10% range, even as welfare spending edges higher.Live EventsJefferies projects central government capital expenditure on defence to rise towards 1% of GDP by FY31, a level last seen four to five years after the Kargil conflict, and highlights that India’s overall defence spend as a share of GDP still trails peers such as Russia, the US and Pakistan, leaving “headroom to rise.”Pay commission risk and market taxationThe looming 8th Central Pay Commission is another big macro swing fa",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/budget-expectations-low-says-jefferies-lists-defence-capex-among-8-measures-to-watch-out-for/articleshow/126760197.cms,economictimes,2026-01-22,neutral

Sun Pharma places non-binding offer for US-based Organon in its boldest global bet ever,"Davos/Mumbai: Dilip Shanghvi-ledSun Pharmaceutical Industries Ltdsubmitted a non-binding offer to acquire US-headquarteredOrganonon Thursday, said people in the know, pushing ahead with its boldest global bet ever.Sun has already tied up acquisition financing in the form of bridge loans from at least three global banks — one each from Wall Street, Europe and Japan — to the tune of $10-14 billion to show its commitment to the board of Organon.The due diligence process will start shortly, following which a binding bid will be made. But being a listed company, typically these dilligences are much shorter in nature.ET was the first to report January 19 on Sun making a play for Organon. The company told the exchanges the news was speculative and did not need any material disclosures.Sun Pharmaand Organon didn’t respond to ET’s queries.Sun's offer is an all-cash deal, said the people. Although the company had been evaluating Organon previously, Sun began serious pursuit in November-December, said the people cited. That’s when Organon decided to sell its JADA post-partum haemorrhage (PPH) treatment system to Laborie Medical for up to $465 million as it sought to pivot from women’s health devices to renew its focus on the women’s health biopharma range. Nexplanon is the company’s top-selling biopharma product, with revenue of $179 million in the second quarter of FY25.Live EventsOrganon is working with Morgan Stanley to find a buyer and Sun could find itself contending with competing bids from global pharma and PE consortia although there hasn’t been any interest from other companies in India, said the people cited. If successful, the deal will be the biggest by any Indian pharmaceutical company. In 2014, Sun acquired Ranbaxy from Daiichi Sankyo for $4 billion in an all-stock trade.Sun was little changed on Monday at Rs 1,673.55 (0.26%) on the BSE, for a market cap of $46.17 billion, in a declining market, following the ET report.

""That's not a very large proportion of our deposit base, and hopefully this impact will moderate going forward, but it has been an issue over the last couple of quarters.""Live EventsOther banks have seen a similar trend, underscoring the sector-wide nature of the pressure.CASA deposits are considered the cheapest source of funding for banks as current accounts carry no interest and savings accounts offer relatively low rates, helping lenders keep their cost of funds low and support margins while expanding credit.Banks are increasingly finding it difficult to mobilise low-cost deposits as savers gravitate towards equities, mutual funds and other investment products offering better returns in a high-rateenvironment.Credit-Deposit RatioAs of December 31, 2025, deposits grew 12.7% year-on-year, while loans expanded faster at 14.5%, according to central bank data.

Tiger Global saga: An interpretation of maladies that's open to more ills,"What's next in theTiger Globalsaga? The buzz is that over the past few daysPricewaterhousehonchos and partners of the law firmNishith Desai Associateshave been discussing theSupreme Court verdictwith legal eagleHarish Salve, sparking a chatter in tax and legal circles that the Wall Street investment firm may examine moving a review petition. Some are betting New Delhi may step in to clear the fog. Why?The wheels within wheels in the 150-page verdict has turned Tiger's tussle with the tax office far from an open and shut case: it would shape the way investors interpret the language of a tax treaty-an animal that emerged in 1920s from the League of Nations.What really changed? Besides doubting thetax residency certificate(TRC) that Tiger Global Mauritius obtained from the island authorities to avoidcapital gains tax, the apex court's interpretation of a crucial article in the India-Mauritius treaty is dramatically different from that of investors, particularly those from the US, and their army of top notch advisors.UPTURNING BELIEFSThe paragraphs 18 and 19 of the ruling are lethal as they upturn the way most believe treaties work. The upshot of paragraph 18 is that capital gains tax should not be exempted for 'indirect transfer' of shares of an Indian company, even if the Mauritius entity has a foolproof TRC and adequate commercial substance which satisfies tax officials.Live EventsA 'direct transfer is a transaction where a Mauritius investor sells shares of an Indian company it directly holds; an 'indirect transfer' is when a Mauritius investor sells shares of a Singapore company which in turn owns an Indian company - similar to the Tiger-Flipkart deal.The bone of contention is Article 13(4) in the revised India-Mauritius treaty which says: ""Gains from alienation of any property other than referred to in paragraphs 1, 2, 3 and 3A shall be taxable only in the contracting state of which the alienator is a resident"".

Ahead of Market: 10 things that will decide stock market action on Tuesday,"The Indian market ended lower on Monday, with the Sensex and Nifty pulling back as global trade-war rhetoric returned to the headlines and heavyweight earnings disappointed at home. The BSE Sensex slid as much as 629 points intraday on Monday, touching a low of 82,941.01, while the NSE Nifty 50 fell 0.7% to an intraday low of 25,504.85.At the end of the day, the Sensex was down about 324 points, or 0.39%, at 83,246.18, while the Nifty shed 109 points, or 0.42%, to 25,585.50, as risk appetite waned.Here's how analysts read the market pulse:Global risk appetite weakened after U.S. President Donald Trump announced new tariff threats against eight European nations, reigniting concerns of a potential U.S.–EU trade dispute, said Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Investments, adding that this development triggered a broad risk‑off mood across global equity markets, prompting investors to rotate toward safe‑haven assets like gold.“Meanwhile, select Asian markets, especially China, displayed relative resilience, supported by favourable macro indicators and stronger‑than‑expected export‑driven GDP growth. Domestically, sentiment remains cautious amid ongoing FII outflows. With the Q3 earnings season progressing, stock‑specific volatility is likely, particularly where performance has been mixed.

"Union Budget FY27: 5 decisions that could shape markets, Kotak Securities says","India’sFY27 Union Budgetis likely to hinge on five quiet but consequential policy choices that could steer both equity and bond markets in the year ahead, according to Kotak Securities. In a volatile global backdrop marked by geopolitical tensions and trade uncertainty, the brokerage expects the government to prioritise stability over spectacle, slowing the pace of fiscal consolidation, sustaining capital expenditure, and leaning on buoyant non-tax revenues, even as higher borrowing risks unsettling the bond market.Kotak Securities projects the Centre’s gross fiscal deficit at 4.3% of GDP in FY27, only marginally lower than the estimated 4.4% in FY26, signalling a deliberate easing in the consolidation glide path. “India’s current economic backdrop, shaped by geopolitical tensions and trade uncertainty, warrants a steady, growth-supportive stance in the FY2027 Union Budget,” the brokerage said.1) A slower fiscal consolidation pathAt the core of Kotak’s Budget math is a conscious decision to slow fiscal tightening. The brokerage noted that the Centre’s debt/GDP target of 50±1% by FY2031 allows room for a modest annual reduction of 10–20 basis points in the fiscal deficit ratio. Against that backdrop, it expects FY27 GFD/GDP to settle at 4.3%, reflecting continued capex momentum, modest tax buoyancy and a largeRBI surplus transfer.2) Limited scope for fiscal stimulus or populismAfter income-tax relief and GST rate cuts in FY26, Kotak sees little headroom for large, market-pleasing giveaways. “Following income tax relief and GST rate cuts in FY2026, and given the prevailing fiscal constraints, we see a limited scope for any large fiscal stimulus in the FY2027 budget,” the report said. With committed expenditure accounting for around 60% of revenue expenditure, outright populism would risk straining the fiscal balance, even as several states have pivoted toward cash-transfer schemes.3) Capex remains the policy anchorThe third key decision, Kotak said, will be to keep th",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/union-budget-fy27-5-decisions-that-could-shape-markets-kotak-securities-says/articleshow/126680424.cms,economictimes,2026-01-22,neutral

Stock-picking on your own?

An analysis of direct and indirect holdings of retail investors byKotak Equitiesshowed that most retail portfolios have delivered weak or barely positive returns over the past 16-18 months.A Kotak Equities study shows that the top 20 retail-heavy stocks in the Nifty-500 have posted negative returns since June 2024, after a strong run-up between March 2023 and June 2024, with similar patterns seen in high retail-owned “narrative stocks.”Among these stocks,Reliance Infrastructure, where retail investors hold around 45%, slipped 13% from June 2024 to December 2025.

"HSBC upgrades Hindustan Zinc to Buy ahead of Q3, ups target price for 2 more metal stocks. Check details","Shares ofHindustan Zincclimbed sharply on Monday, gaining over 4% to hit an intraday high of Rs 663 after international brokerage HSBC upgraded the stock to Buy from Hold and raised its target price to Rs 750 per share, implying an 18% upside. The move comes ahead of the company’s Q3 earnings announcement later today.HSBC said it has incorporated updated LME zinc and silver price forecasts, raising its FY2026–28 assumptions by around 5% to 23%. This led to a 12% to 20% increase in EBITDA estimates for FY2027–28. The brokerage now values Hindustan Zinc at 11x FY27E EV/EBITDA, up from 9.5x earlier, placing it at the higher end of its five-year trading range of 5x to 11x. The valuation reflects the company’s strong balance sheet and a stable-to-improving outlook for LME zinc and silver prices. “We see further earnings upside potential from spot LME zinc and silver prices,” HSBC said.Alongside Hindustan Zinc, HSBC has also raised target prices for two other metal stocks,HindalcoandNational Aluminium Company(NALCO).For Hindalco, the brokerage has increased the target price to Rs 1,240 from Rs 1,060, implying a 33% upside, and raised EBITDA estimates by around 7% to 10% for FY2027–28. HSBC said it has factored in higher global LME aluminium and copper price forecasts, increasing FY2026–28 aluminium assumptions by about 5% to 16% and copper forecasts by around 5% to 20%, which drove the roughly 17% upgrade in the target price. The India business is valued at 7x FY27E EV/EBITDA, unchanged, representing a slight premium to its long-term average given the strong aluminium price outlook.

Insurance firms cut stakes in these 10 stocks during December quarter,"A decrease in insurance shareholding indicates that insurance companies have reduced their stakes in a specific company during the current quarter compared to the previous one.

IFCI shares surges 30% in 5 days on NSE IPO buzz,"Shares of leading NBFCIFCIjumped as much as 4.6% to Rs 63.48 in Monday’s trade, taking gains to nearly 30% over the past five sessions.

Tata Motors PV shares fall over 4%.

The company said volumes were adversely affected as production only returned to normal levels by mid-November following the cyber incident.The automaker noted that both wholesale and retail volumes declined on a quarter-on-quarter as well as year-on-year basis due to these operational challenges. The impact was further compounded by the ongoing planned wind-down of legacy Jaguar models ahead of the launch of the new Jaguar range, which continued to weigh on volumes through the quarter, in line with expectations.Live EventsAdditionally, JLR highlighted that incremental US tariffs affecting exports to the US market also contributed to the pressure on volumes during the quarter.Despite the overall volume decline, the company saw an improvement in its product mix.

It is becoming the new standard in India’s F&O markets,"Not long ago, algorithmic trading in India was something most retail traders admired from a distance. It was fast, complex, and mostly used by institutions or high-frequency desks. But all of that is changing, and quickly.Thanks to SEBI’s 2025 framework, retail algo trading has moved from grey areas and technical hacks to a regulated, structured space. What was once a luxury for the few is now becoming the foundation for many, especially in India’s futures and options (F&O) markets.From Unregulated Tools to a Safe, Structured SystemEarlier, many retail traders turned to third-party apps, self-made scripts, or informal tools to automate their trades. These setups worked, but often without any broker oversight, risk checks, or transparency. It was fast, but also risky.SEBI has now stepped in with a clear rulebook. Under the new guidelines:All strategies must be approved by the exchangeEach strategy is tagged with a unique ID to track every orderBrokers must host and monitor all strategies on their own systemsRisk controls like position limits and kill switches are built in, not optionalEvery strategy must be tested in a live-like environment before going liveIn short, retail traders can still use automation, but now it happens inside a safe and visible system, with real checks in place.Live EventsWhat These Strategies Look Like NowYou no longer need to write complex code or hire a developer. Most retail algo platforms now offer a menu of pre-built strategies. You pick one, set your capital and risk preferences, and the system does the rest.Some popular strategy types include:Momentum strategies that jump into trades during strong price movesTrend-following models that ride longer market trends with automated exitsOptions algos like straddles or strangles that trade around volatilityEach one is tested, approved, and comes with defined rules. You are not betting on guesswork. You are following a system.Why This Matters in F&O TradingF&O trading is fast.

"As FIIs pull out and drag India stock market returns, will billion-dollar SIP inflows crack?","Indianequitymarkets have begun 2026 on a shaky note. Foreign investors are selling, global headlines are turning messy, and stock prices have struggled to find direction after a difficult 2025.Niftyis already down 2% this year after underperforming most major equity markets last year. If the markets continue to stay weak and volatile, will systematic investment plans (SIPs) -- the backbone of domestic equity flows -- start to crack?At first glance, the fear seems logical.Equity returnshave disappointed, mid- and smallcap stocks have corrected sharply. But a closer look at the data shows SIPs appear far more resilient than past market cycles.Even as market sentiment weakened throughout the last year, DecemberSIPflows hit a fresh record.SIP inflowsrose to Rs 31,000 crore in December 2025, up from Rs 29,400 crore in November. The broader mutual fund ecosystem also held steady. Monthly average assets under management for the industry remained around Rs 82 lakh crore. Equity assets under management stayed firm at about Rs 35.5 lakh crore.Analysts say this stability indicates that SIPs are not tactical trades, but have become automated habits linked to salaries, long-term goals and financial discipline. Unlike lump-sum investing, SIPs do not require investors to make repeated decisions during market stress.Balasubramanian, Managing Director and CEO of Aditya Birla Sun Life AMC said record inflows are a testament to SIPs increasingly becoming a way of life for Indian investors, while adding that continued investments despite volatility point to rising financial awareness and discipline.Live EventsPoor market returns don't mean poor SIP outcomesWhile stock prices struggled in 2025, SIP investors.

"Asian stocks dip, gold hits record as tariff woes return","Risk assets slipped and haven demand strengthened after US President Donald Trump proposed new levies on eight European countries, reviving tariff-related worries across markets. The dollar fell.US equity-index futures slumped as trading started on Monday, with contracts for the Nasdaq 100 retreating as much as 1%. Gold hit a record of over $4,680 an ounce and silver surged around 4% to an all-time high. Brent crude declined almost 1%. Treasury futures gained, while the dollar weakened against all its Group-of-10 peers, losing the most against the Swiss Franc and the Japanese yen.Stocks in Australia and Japan fell with cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin, also declining.The return oftariff concernscomes as risk appetite has been underpinned by strong earnings and heavy investment linked to artificial intelligence. That presents a fresh test for stock markets, which have climbed to record highs on the AI-led rally after rebounding from the selloff triggered by Trump’s century-high levies.“The immediate market reaction is likely to be a classic uncertainty shock,” said Shoki Omori, chief desk strategist at Mizuho Securities Co. in Tokyo. “It’s a clear signal that tariffs are being redefined as a geopolitical weapon rather than an economic negotiating tool. The point is not the initial 10%. The point is that nothing is ring-fenced anymore.”Live EventsTrump said over the weekend he’d impose a 10% tariff on goods from eight European countries starting Feb. 1, rising to 25% in June unless there’s a deal for a “purchase of Greenland.”The move drew quick rebukes from European leaders, who are now poised to halt the approval of the trade agreement struck last year.

What Tiger Global ruling means for foreign investors,"A recent Supreme Court ruling in the Tiger Global-Flipkart share sale case has brought India's tax treaties back into focus. Here's a look at what it means for foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) and private equity (PE) funds.What did the court actually rule?The Supreme Court ruled that foreign investors cannot rely solely on a Tax Residency Certificate (TRC) to claim tax benefits under aDouble Taxation Avoidance Agreement(DTAA). The court held that tax authorities are entitled to examine thecommercial substanceof overseas investment structures while assessing treaty claims.The ruling also clarified that such examination is not barred merely because the investment was made before April 1, 2017 - the date from which India's General Anti-Avoidance Rules (GAAR) formally came into force.What do terms like DTAA, commercial substance and GAAR mean?DTAA (Double Taxation Avoidance Agreement) is a tax treaty between two countries that decides which country can tax an investor's income and prevents the same income from being taxed twice.Live EventsCommercial substance means that an investment structure has real business activity in the country where it claims tax residence, such as employees or operations, and has not been set up only to claim tax benefits.GAAR (General Anti-Avoidance Rule) allows the Indian tax department to deny tax benefits if a structure is created mainly to avoid tax and lacks commercial substance.What does this SC ruling change?The ruling changes the long-held comfort that possession of a valid TRC by itself is sufficient to secure treaty benefits. The court made it clear that a TRC is necessary but treaty protection can be denied if the underlying structure does not show commercial substance.What does this mean for FPIs? Who could be impacted now?The ruling has implications for private equity exits routed through Mauritius, Singapore and Cyprus, which have historically been the preferred routes for several foreign entities to invest in India.

""In the future, we need to operate in a model that is acceptable to the regulator,"" HDFC Bank chief financial officer Srinivasan Vaidyanathan said during an earnings call. ""The recalibration of our book is driven by the scale of finance, to clearly classify what is genuinely an agriculture loan and what falls outside that remit.""Regulators have been closely scrutinising banks for the over-classification of agricultural loans, particularly where borrowings are partly used for non-farm purposes. The RBI has asked banks to tighten agri loan classification by ensuring that only credit meeting genuine farm requirements-as defined by the official scale of finance-is treated as agricultural lending. Any lending beyond these thresholds is required to be reclassified or managed under non-agri categories.Market participants said the additional provisioning reflects regulatory action rather than asset quality stress. ""The RBI has asked some banks to declassify these loans as PSL, and even though there are no provisioning gaps, this is effectively a punishment in the form of additional capital set aside,"" said Ashutosh Mishra, head of institutional equities research at Ashika Stock Broking.

"What do Trump’s Greenland tariff threats to NATO allies mean for gold, silver and Dalal Street?","U.S. President Donald Trump’s latest bid to force a deal on Greenland, this time by threatening steep tariffs on a cluster of NATO allies, has injected fresh uncertainty into global markets, potentially pushing investors toward gold and silver while raising short-term volatility risks for equities, including in India, even as longer-term trade opportunities quietly come into focus.On Saturday, Trump said the U.S. would impose a 10% tariff from 1 February 2026 on imports from Denmark, Norway, Sweden, France, Germany, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands and Finland, escalating the levy to 25% from 1 June if those countries refuse to negotiate the sale of Greenland, a Danish territory. The announcement, made in a social media post, marked Trump’s most aggressive attempt yet to pressure Europe over the strategically important Arctic island.Tariffs as leverageTrump said the tariffs would remain in place “until a Deal is reached for the Complete and Total purchase of Greenland,” arguing that U.S. control of the island is essential to counter Chinese and Russian ambitions in the Arctic. Denmark and its European allies have rejected those demands, triggering a rare show of unity among European leaders, who reacted with outrage on Saturday.The threat also drew criticism from U.S. lawmakers, including some members of the president’s own party. Adding to the uncertainty, the U.S. Supreme Court is currently weighing whether to overturn the legal authority Trump has used to threaten tariffs under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act. If the court rules against him, Trump may not be able to impose the new levies.The proposed duties would likely be imposed on top of existing tariffs, currently 10% on British imports and 15% on imports from the European Union, raising questions about retaliation and the broader impact on global trade. While tariffs are paid by importers, the costs are often passed on to American consumers, complicating the inflation outlook.Safe havens b",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/what-do-trumps-greenland-tariff-threats-to-nato-allies-mean-for-gold-silver-and-dalal-street/articleshow/126640083.cms,economictimes,2026-01-22,neutral

FII shorts highest since March 2025. How to trade Nifty now,"Foreign institutional investors have built their largest index futures short positions since March 2025, pushing the long–short ratio close to record lows. However, a sharp rise in index futures longs on a non-expiry day signals potential short covering ahead, setting the stage for heightened volatility and tactical trading opportunities in the January series.Edited excerpts from a chat with Anand James, Chief Market Strategist, Geojit Investments:Nifty ended the week flat, but on Monday, the market would react to earnings of heavyweights like RIL, HDFC Bank and ICICI Bank. What are the key levels to watch out for?Our eyes are on 26,020 as the near-term objective, encouraged by a parallel consolidation bias since 9th January, apparently putting a pause to the downside spree that has been on since the start of this year. However, the systematic uptick in VIX, albeit small, suggests that volatility expectations are rising, and hence it would be prudent to factor in wild swings. This would also mean that we will have to acknowledge a fair potential for falls to the 200-day SMA, now at 25,090, should we see slippage past 25,600.Nifty Bank outperformed during the week, but PSU banks fared even better. Which side of the trade would you be on in the week ahead?Between Nifty Bank and Nifty PSU Bank indices, the latter has the better momentum, having closed at a new record peak for the second consecutive day. This would also mean that should there be a broad market negativity, the PSU Bank Index could slip faster.

SIP stocks! HDFC Securities names 10 companies to accumulate in 2026. Check details,"Amid heightened volatility in early 2026, HDFC Securities has identified 10 stocks to accumulate through 2026, spanning small-, mid- and large-cap companies across sectors. The picks are anchored in strong fundamentals, healthy balance sheets and long-term earnings visibility, offering investors a disciplined way to navigate market swings and build wealth over the year. HDFC says the international business remains well-diversified, with no single geography outside of Europe and Canada accounting for 5% of total sales. Emcure’s product portfolio in international markets comprises a mix of specialty branded generics, injectables and generic products. The company has built a complex portfolio (40% of export sales), comprising chiral molecules, injectable, iron compounds and biologics. The company reiterated its guidance to reach Rs 10,000 crore in revenue for Paints (and turn the segment profitable) in FY28. Management indicated revenue market share (including putty revenue) has crossed 10% in the organised decorative paints market. While we stay optimistic, further revenue traction in paints remains the key monitorable. The company has been able to roll-out CNG and PNG distribution network across authorised GAs by installing infrastructure such as pipeline network, compressor stations and a marketing network. IGL has 954 CNG stations (FY24: 882), 12,049 Industrial and commercial PNG connections and 30.70 lakh domestic PNG connections as on Mar. 31, 2025.

"Rs 2.5 lakh crore IPO boom in 2026 could create ‘liquidity drain’, says HDFC Securities; pegs Nifty at 28,720","The Indian equity market heads into 2026 facing an unusual paradox. On the one hand, optimism around growth, earnings recovery and policy support is building. On the other, a flood of new listings threatens to stretch liquidity and test investor appetite. According to HDFC Securities, the coming year could well be defined by how markets navigate this delicate balance.The most immediate challenge is the sheer scale of theIPO pipeline. More than 190 companies are expected to tap the primary market in 2026, collectively seeking to raise over Rs 2.5 lakh crore. Such a heavy issuance calendar raises a fundamental question: will the IPO rush end up killing the goose that laid the golden eggs? HDFC Securities flags the risk of a “liquidity drain” in the secondary market as capital is diverted towards new listings. With investor funds being absorbed by fresh paper, trading activity and price discovery in listed stocks could come under pressure.Compounding this concern is the uncertainty around foreign investor flows. Even after a meaningful consolidation in 2025, Indian equities continue to trade at a premium to otheremerging marketssuch as China and Brazil. Foreign institutional investors pulled out nearly Rs 3 lakh crore from Indian equities in 2025. While there is hope that flows could stabilize or even reverse in 2026, HDFC Securities cautions that several factors may still keep foreign capital on the sidelines.That said, the broader global and domestic backdrop offers reasons for guarded optimism. Global trade uncertainty is expected to gradually come down, aided by easing geopolitical tensions and the prospect of tariff reversals. Trump’s trade policies, which have been a major source of disruption, are expected to diminish further as a dominant influence on the global economy. “Emerging markets rotation is anticipated, with India as a key beneficiary,” it added.Within this framework, emerging market rotation is anticipated, with India seen as a key beneficiary.

The pace of outflows accelerated in the holiday-shortened week, with foreign investors offloading Rs 14,266 crore worth of shares in just four sessions.FIIs remained net sellers, extending their recent selling trends as tariff-related uncertainties and geopolitical tensions offset the optimism from better-than-expectedQ3 earningsby select large-cap IT companies, said Ajit Mishra, Senior Vice President, Research atReligareBroking.Given the mixed domestic and global backdrop and persistent foreign fund outflows, it is essential to manage leverage and position sizes prudently, he recommended.The FIIs were net sellers in December, offloading domestic shares worth Rs 22,611 crore during the month while taking total outflows in 2025 to Rs 1,66,286 crore.FIIs sold shares worth Rs 11,766 crore in Q3 after offloading shares worth Rs 76,619 crore in the third quarter of CY25. They reversed the buying trends seen in the April–June period when inflows totalled Rs 38,673 crore. The year had opened on a sharply negative note, with foreign investors pulling out a massive Rs 1,16,574 crore during the January–March quarter.Live EventsMarket expert V K Vijayakumar blames the relatively elevated valuations in India and the AI trade as major factors behind the FII exodus in the year gone by.

"Nifty consolidates below 25,900 as markets await decisive trigger","The truncated week saw the markets largely consolidating in a narrow range, with Nifty ending the week almost flat with a marginal positive bias. There was a trading holiday on Thursday due to the municipal elections in Mumbai.The benchmark index witnessed low participation and remained range-bound throughout, given the lack of any major triggers. Nifty oscillated within a tight band of 426.40 points, marking an intra-week high of 25,899.80 and a low of 25,473.40.India VIXedged slightly higher by 4.10% to 11.37, indicating a marginal uptick in volatility expectations, although it remains within historically benign levels. Nifty closed the week with a minor gain of 11.05 points (+0.04%).AgenciesThe index continues to stay in a defined consolidation zone just below its recent high, exhibiting a broad-ranging behavior without any decisive breakout. Nifty is trading within a horizontal resistance zone marked near 25,900, while it continues to defend the 100-DMA (25,570) on a closing basis. Structurally, the markets are not in a trending phase and appear to be in a time-wise consolidation which suggests that Nifty is awaiting a decisive catalyst. A sustained move above 25,900–26,000 could open up room for a fresh breakout, while a breach below 25,400–25,350 may trigger incremental weakness.Live EventsFor the upcoming week, a quiet-to-cautious start cannot be ruled out unless the index manages to decisively clear 25,900. Key resistance zones are seen at 25,900 and 26,150 levels, while supports are expected around 25,500 and 25,200. A breakdown below these levels may bring the 24,700–24,800 zone back into focus.The weekly RSI stands at 53.31 and remains neutral without showing any bullish or bearish divergence against the price.

Retail investors trim stakes in 12 small-cap stocks for 3 straight quarters; 3 surge over 100% in FY26,"As December-quarter shareholding data for nearly 505 small-cap companies begins to roll out, early disclosures are already revealing an interesting market contradiction. A deeper analysis shows that retail investors have steadily reduced their stakes for three consecutive quarters in FY26 across 68 small-cap stocks. (Note: Retail investors are resident individuals holding nominal share capital up to Rs 2 lakhs)What makes this trend intriguing is the price action. More than half of these stocks—35 out of 68—have delivered double-digit returns in FY26 so far, even as retail participation continued to decline. Is this retail profit-booking after a strong rally, or are investors prematurely stepping aside and missing the next leg of upside? The answer, as always, lies somewhere between caution and conviction—and only time will tell. In this analysis, we spotlight 12 small-cap stocks that surged between 40% and 130% during FY26, including three multibaggers, highlighting a growing disconnect between ownership trends and market performance.

Smallcap stocks jump up to 62% this week! How many do you own?,"After a bruising 2025, when the Nifty Smallcap 100 index fell nearly 6%, 2026 is shaping up to be another difficult year—at least judging by January’s early trend. While the index is already down about 2%, several pockets across sectors such as metal, financials among others have stood out as clear outliers, delivering sharp gains of up to 62% in just a week. Here’s the full list of the best-performing smallcap stocks in the week gone by. The stock has risen 62% this week to emerge as the top-performing smallcap stock. It manufactures electric vehicles (EVs), primarily electric two-wheelers and three-wheelers, under brands like Joy e-bike and Joy E-Rik, focusing on creating a sustainable EV ecosystem in India. The stock has gained 40% this week, placing it among the strongest smallcap performers. It manufactures and sells a wide range of steel tubes and pipes, including ERW black pipes, galvanized pipes, hollow sections (square, rectangular, circular), and structural steel, catering to construction, infrastructure, and automotive sectors. The stock has advanced 36% this week, delivering sharp weekly gains. It is an Indian energy company focused on oil and gas exploration and production (E&P), operating fields in Gujarat like Bakrol, Lohar, and Karjisan, and exploring in Assam and Andhra Pradesh.

"Auto upcycle gains depth; M&M and TVS Motors stand out, Siddhartha Khemka explains","The domestic automobile sector continues to display resilient momentum, with demand sustaining well beyond the festive period. Aggregate industry volumes in the December quarter expanded 17% year-on-year, supported by healthy traction across all major segments.Two-wheelers and passenger vehicles both recorded 17% growth, while commercial vehicles rose 22% and tractors advanced 21%.Importantly, retail momentum in November and December remained firm, indicating that festive-led buying was not a one-off spike but part of a broader recovery trend.Strong volume recovery is translating into robust financial performance. Sector revenues are expected to grow around 24% year-on-year, while operating profit and net profit are projected to rise by about 27% each.Input costs have edged up sequentially due to higher precious metal prices, but this has been partly offset by softer steel prices, moderation in discounts—particularly in passenger vehicles—and operating leverage benefits.Live EventsAggregate EBITDA margins are estimated to improve marginally by around 30 basis points year-on-year to nearly 13.5%, with no major players expected to see a meaningful margin contraction.Ancillary suppliers are also benefiting from the recovery in original equipment demand. Revenues in this segment are estimated to grow by roughly 14%, with EBITDA and profit expected to rise by about 17% and 20%, respectively.Tyre manufacturers are seeing margin expansion on the back of lower raw material costs, while select component manufacturers are reporting sharp margin recovery from a low base, even as a few niche players continue to face pressure.Several structural and near-term trends are reinforcing the outlook. Entry-level vehicles in both two-wheelers and passenger vehicles are witnessing a visible pickup in demand following recent tax rationalisation measures.Strong wholesales and healthy retail sales have kept inventories lean, which should support volume momentum into the next quarter.

Sebi approves separate auction session to determine closing stock prices,"Capital markets regulatorSebihas decided to change the wayclosing prices of sharesare calculated in the equity cash market. Instead of using the average price of trades in the last 30 minutes of trading, exchanges will move to a new system called theClosing Auction Session(CAS).At present, the closing price of a stock is based on the volume-weighted average price of trades between 3:00 pm and 3:30 pm. Sebi said this method can sometimes distort prices, especially for large orders placed nearmarket close. Globally, most major markets already use an auction-based system to decide closing prices.Under the new framework, CAS will run for 20 minutes from 3:15 pm to 3:35 pm on all trading days. The session will have separate phases for calculating a reference price, order entry, and order matching. Orders will close randomly in the last two minutes to prevent manipulation.Initially, CAS will apply only to stocks that havederivatives contracts. For other shares, the existing VWAP-based method will continue for now. The reference price for the auction will be calculated using the VWAP of trades between 3:00 pm and 3:15 pm. If there are no trades in that window, the last traded price of the day will be used.During CAS, both market and limit orders will be allowed, but stop-loss and iceberg orders will not be permitted. The closing price will be discovered through an equilibrium price mechanism, which selects the price at which the maximum volume can be matched. If multiple prices qualify, Sebi has laid out clear rules to pick the final closing price.Live EventsSebi said the change will make closing prices more transparent and reliable. This is important because closing prices are used for derivative settlement, index calculation, and mutual fund NAVs. The regulator also noted that CAS will help passive funds and large investors execute trades at fair prices with lower impact costs.Along with CAS, Sebi has also aligned the pre-open auction session with the new framework.

Sebi proposes easing cash settlement norms for foreign investors to cut funding costs,"Capital markets regulator Sebi has proposed allowing foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) to net their cash obligations for stock market transactions, a move aimed at improving operational efficiency and reducing funding costs, especially during high-volume trading days such as index rebalancing.In a consultation paper released on January 16, Sebi said the current settlement framework requires FPIs to settle all cash market trades on a gross basis at the custodian level, even if their buy and sell positions offset each other on the same day.The paper comes in the wake of heavy selling from foreign investors since the last one year. FIIs have sold $21 billion of equities from the beginning of 2025.While custodians eventually settle with clearing corporations on a net basis, FPIs are required to bring in full funds for purchases and deliver securities for sales separately, leading to higher temporary liquidity requirements.Sebi noted that this structure often leaves FPIs underinvested for at least one day and exposes them to additional costs such as forex conversion slippage and short-term funding expenses. These issues become more pronounced during index reshuffling days, when FPIs execute large buy and sell trades simultaneously.Live EventsUnder the proposed framework, Sebi has suggested permitting ""netting of funds"" for outright buy and outright sell transactions carried out by an FPI in the cash market on the same settlement day. This would allow sale proceeds to be adjusted against purchase obligations, requiring FPIs to fund only the net cash amount.However, trades where an investor both buys and sells the same security within the same settlement cycle will continue to be settled on a gross basis, in line with existing rules.Sebi said discussions with custodians, clearing corporations and stock exchanges highlighted potential risks, including higher chances of trade rejection and increased settlement risk for custodians.

"Buy gold, sell Bitcoin: Jefferies' Chris Wood explains his big bet of 2026","Christopher Wood, the prominent global strategist at Jefferies, is liquidatingBitcoinholdings and reallocating capital back to physical gold. The quantum computing threat to Bitcoin's cryptographic foundations has prompted Wood to overhaul his asset allocation strategy, signaling that digital currencies may not prove to be the stable stores of value their proponents long claimed them to be.The catalyst for this dramatic reversal is not market performance, but rather an emerging existential risk to the Bitcoin system itself. Research from Chaincode Labs, cited prominently in Wood's analysis, estimates that between 20 and 50 percent of all bitcoins currently in circulation, totaling between 4 and 10 million BTC, could become vulnerable to theft once cryptographically relevant quantum computers (CRQCs) become a reality.While quantum computing threats have long been discussed in theoretical circles, the acceleration of development timelines has shifted the conversation from speculation to preparation.""While GREED & fear does not believe that the quantum issue is about to hit the Bitcoin price dramatically in the near term, the store of value concept is clearly on less solid foundation from the standpoint of a long-term pension portfolio.

"‘India’s biggest startup-investment window is now open despite pessimism,’ says Zerodha CEO Nithin Kamath","At a time when markets are preoccupied with earnings volatility and geopolitical risk, Zerodha founder and CEO Nithin Kamath said investors and entrepreneurs are overlooking a larger, more enduring opportunity.In a post on social media platform X onNational Startup Day, Kamath argued that despite widespread pessimism about India’s growth prospects, the country is entering its most powerful phase yet for building companies, one shaped by deep domestic capital, policy support and technology that has radically lowered the cost of ambition.""There's a lot of pessimism about India's growth prospects right now, amplified by the sheer amount of geopolitical drama we're living through.

FIIs boost stake in Suzlon Energy to 23.73% in December quarter,"Foreign Institutional Investors (FIIs) have steadily increased their stake inSuzlon Energy, raising their holding from 22.70% in September 2025 to 23.73% in the December quarter. This is the highest FII ownership level seen in the past four quarters, reflecting strengthening confidence among global institutional investors. Given thatFIIstypically follow a research-driven and long-term investment strategy, this uptick in their stake serves as a positive signal for retail investors. It indicates that institutional investors may be positioning for potential future gains, even as the stock has faced near-term volatility.In contrast, domestic mutual funds (MFs) reduced their holdings for the second consecutive quarter, with their stake slipping to 4.82%. Similarly, small retail investors (resident individuals holding shares worth up to Rs 2 lakh) marginally trimmed their exposure, with their shareholding falling from 26.20% in September to 25.89% in December — suggesting either profit-booking or a more cautious stance.The overall shareholding structure at the end of December 2025 shows promoters holding 11.73% with zero pledged shares, providing comfort on governance. FIIs command a significant 23.73% stake, DIIs account for 9.24%, and retail investors collectively hold 39.07%, split between small investors at 26.20% and larger resident individuals at 12.87%.On the performance front, Suzlon Energy has delivered a muted return over the past year, declining nearly 14%, but its long-term performance over three years has been remarkable, delivering nearly 400% gains for investors. Analysts remain optimistic, with Trendlyne data showing a “STRONG BUY” consensus from 10 analysts, and an average price target implying upside potential of around 45% from current levels.From a valuation and technical perspective, the stock trades at a PE ratio of 21.18 and a PB ratio of 10.96.

At the end of the December quarter, SHCIL owned 4.4% in NSE. In the unlisted market, NSE shares are trading around Rs 2,100 per share. Going by that, SHCIL's stake in NSE is worth around Rs 23,000 crore. IFCI owns 52% stake in SHCIL.NSE IPO coming soon?Last week, Sebi chief had said that it is in a very advanced stage of issuing the NOC (no-objection certificate) for NSE IPO, and that could happen as soon as this month itself. At another event on Thursday, he said Sebi has agreed in principle to NSE's settlement application in the long-running unfair market access case.He also said the government has approved a 2.5% stake dilution in the exchange and that a notification in this regard will be issued soon. The development is being seen as the strongest signal yet that the country's largest stock exchange may finally move closer to an IPO.The NSE has been seeking regulatory approval for its IPO for several years, following governance lapses and the co-location controversy that had come under SEBI’s scrutiny.

Will Budget bring back FIIs? Morgan Stanley's Ridham Desai expects 3 reforms to revive foreign flows,"After $21 billion of relentless selling by foreign institutional investors (FIIs) since the beginning of 2025, India’s equity strategists are increasingly turning to the UnionBudgetas a potential pivot point. Morgan Stanley’sRidham Desai, who leads the firm’s India equity strategy team, has identified three specific capital market reforms that could meaningfully reverse the FII outflow narrative that has plagued Indian markets.“There has been growing concern about the negative balance of payments and foreign portfolio investor (FPI) selling. In this context, it is quite possible that the Budget proposes broadening the base of foreign portfolio investors, allowing more pools of capital to access Indian stocks,” Desai said in a Budget strategy note.The two other reforms could focus on simplifying buyback taxation—which currently risks distorting capital structures and hurting long-term capital market flows—and further enhancing tax benefits at GIFT City, he said.As global financial flows increasingly route through international financial centres, GIFT City has emerged as a potential hub but remains underdeveloped compared with peers such as Singapore and Hong Kong. By sharpening tax incentives and strengthening regulatory frameworks, the government could attract more foreign capital into Indian securities through platforms such as the Gateway International Exchange. This would create additional avenues for FII participation, particularly for investors facing regulatory or structural constraints in traditional market-access mechanisms.India has seen around $2 billion in net foreign investor outflows so far this year, following a $19 billion sell-off in 2025.Live Events“It appears the market is expecting modest fiscal consolidation to protect growth, flat to higher capital spending as a percentage of GDP, and some additional tax incentives for manufacturing,” he said, adding that the Budget is likely to focus on deficit reduction, government capital expenditure, the deb",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/will-budget-bring-back-fiis-morgan-stanleys-ridham-desai-expects-3-reforms-to-revive-foreign-flows/articleshow/126559892.cms,economictimes,2026-01-22,neutral

The rally reflects investor optimism as the IT major prepares to announce its Q3 earnings later today, with the Street watching for updates on margins, deal wins and the impact of recent acquisitions such as Harman.According to an average of estimates from six brokerages, Wipro’s profit after tax for Q3FY26 is expected to rise by just 0.4% year-on-year.

However, it flagged a 30 basis point currency headwind and warned of subdued margins due to furloughs and integration costs.Centrum Broking sees 1.2% QoQ growth in constant currency, including 0.5% organic growth and 0.7% from Harman.

"YES Bank Q3 Results Preview: Profit likely to jump 27% YoY, NII seen rising up to 12%; here’s what else to expect","YES Bank is scheduled to announce its December-quarter results on Saturday (January 17) with brokerages anticipating a mixed performance. Analysts expect a patchy recovery, steady but muted growth in core income, largely stable margins, and a broad range of profit estimates. While investors continue to favour peers such as HDFC Bank, ICICI Bank, Axis Bank, Kotak Mahindra Bank, and select public sector lenders, expectations from YES Bank remain cautious. Brokerages are divided — some foresee a modest earnings improvement, while others expect a stronger year-on-year jump driven by a lower base effect.The private lender is expected to deliver high single-digit to low double-digit growth in net interest income (NII) in Q3FY26, with estimates clustering between 9% and nearly 12% YoY. Net profit (PAT) forecasts, however, span a much wider band—from low single-digit growth to as much as 27% YoY, reflecting divergent assumptions on credit costs, operating leverage, and the pace of balance-sheet repair. Loan growth is seen in the mid-single digits YoY, deposits growing at a similar or slightly higher pace, and net interest margins (NIMs) broadly stable with mild volatility.YES Bank will declare its financial results for the quarter and nine months ended December 31, 2025, and subsequently hold a post-earnings conference call with analysts and investors at 2:45 pm on the same day.The broad picture: steady NII, uneven profit recoveryAcross brokerages, the consensus view is that YES Bank’s operating performance continues to improve incrementally but lags sector leaders. NII growth is expected to remain resilient despite pressure on loan yields and a competitive deposit environment, aided by balance-sheet stability and controlled funding costs. NIMs are largely seen as flat to marginally higher or lower on a sequential basis, depending on assumptions around rate cuts, CRR-related benefits, and deposit repricing.Live EventsProfitability remains the swing factor.

China’s $1.2 trillion windfall quietly seeps into global markets,"A record trade surplus racked up byChinais washing up around the world, as export earnings that once ended up in state coffers instead fund massive private purchases of overseas securities and business expansion abroad.Rather than leaving most of last year’s $1.2 trillion windfall in the hands of the central bank, some two-thirds of the foreign assets sourced primarily from global trade ended up with companies, individuals and state lenders. That brings with it the risk of a sudden capital reversal that China doesn’t immediately control, especially in a world where the yuan is allowed to strengthen.Investors comprising China’s so-called non-official sector saw their holdings of assets abroad soar by more than $1 trillion in the first three quarters of last year — according to the latest available data from China’s currency market regulator — more than double the annual average growth in the past decade.BloombergPutting that money to work last year resulted in a $535 billion surge in Chinese private purchases of overseas securities like US stocks, European bonds and mutual funds, Bloomberg calculations show, though a more detailed geographical breakdown of the investments isn’t available. The increase through September outpaced any full-year increase over the past two decades and was far more than poured out of China in the form of direct investments used to build factories and warehouses or expand staffing abroad.Live EventsThe quiet migration of capital into global markets is ushering in a new era that does away with a centralized system of managing the wealth reeled in from China’s outsized role in manufacturing and commerce. For a world already uneasy over the huge imbalances in trade, another outcome is a global financial system increasingly reliant on liquidity sourced from China.“As China’s private investment footprint grows, it will inevitably play a larger role in global capital flows,” said Peiqian Liu, an Asia economist at Fidelity International, which man",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/chinas-1-2-trillion-windfall-quietly-seeps-into-global-markets/articleshow/126555689.cms,economictimes,2026-01-22,neutral

Banks' credit-to-deposit ratio hits record 81.75% as mobilisation lags,"Mumbai:Indian banks' credit-to-deposit (CD) ratio climbed to an all-time high of 81.75% as of December 31, indicating pressure on lenders to shore up deposits amid risingloan demand,Reserve Bank of Indiadata showed.The ratio means banks lent ₹81.75 for every ₹100 of deposits mobilised. While the RBI does not prescribe a cap, it has urged lenders to maintain adequate liquidity buffers to meet unexpected withdrawals.Banks have asked the RBI to include bond borrowings in the CD ratio calculation, which would help bring it below 80%. Currently, only deposits and certificates of deposit are considered for computing the ratio.Typically, out of every ₹100 in deposits, banks set aside ₹3 for cash reserve requirements, ₹18 for statutory reserves and hold ₹3-5 in additional government securities to comply with liquidity coverage rules. After these allocations, the amount available for lending works out to ₹75-76.Live EventsThe elevated CD ratio reflects challenges in mobilising deposits as investors seek higher returns elsewhere.Small savings schemescurrently offer 7.10% for three-year deposits, compared with 6.40-6.50% offered by banks.The challenge intensified after the RBI cut its policy rate by 125 basis points since February 2025, prompting lenders to reduce deposit rates. The weighted average rate on outstanding term deposits fell to 6.73%, the lowest since September 2023, while fresh deposits averaged 5.59%, the lowest since October 2022.Deposit mobilisationhas lagged credit growth. Bank credit rose 11.4% in 2025, while deposits grew 10.1%. Outstanding deposits were ₹248.5 lakh crore, while credit was ₹202 lakh crore as of December 31.""To overcome this challenge, banks will have to explore alternative sources such as bond issuance to finance credit growth,"" said Saurabh Bhalerao, associate director and head of BFSI Research atCare Ratings. ""The pace of investments in government securities has slowed, implying banks are deploying funds for lending,"" he added.Fresh inves",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/banks-credit-to-deposit-ratio-hits-record-81-75-as-mobilisation-lags/articleshow/126555068.cms,economictimes,2026-01-22,neutral
Ahead of Market: 10 things that will decide stock market action on Friday,"The Indian market observed a trading holiday today on account of the Maharashtra Municipal Corporation Elections on Thursday.On Wednesday, the market ended lower, with theSensex and Niftyextending their slide as worries over potential U.S. tariffs and persistent foreign investor outflows outweighed gains in metal and banking stocks.The benchmark BSE Sensex slipped 245 points, or 0.29%, to end at 83,382.71, while the NSE Nifty 50 fell 66.7 points, or 0.26%, to 25,665.60.

"Morgan Stanley starts Meesho coverage with equal-weight; flags full valuation. Check target, upside potential","International brokerage Morgan Stanley has initiated coverage on newly listedMeeshowith an Equal-weight rating and a target price of Rs 169 per share, citing full valuations following the stock’s strong post-listing run-up. The target price suggests an upside of about 3% from current levels.The brokerage said valuations look full as Meesho’s advertising business remains at an early stage of monetisation, while the company continues to focus on rapid user expansion. Consequently, Morgan Stanley expects steady-state profitability to be a few years away.The brokerage believes investors are likely to value the business either by discounting FY31 adjusted EBITDA margins back to the present or by applying an EV toNMV multipleon FY28 estimates, similar to the EV to revenue approach used for offline retail. On its estimates, Meesho is currently trading at 1.14x FY28 EV to NMV, which it views as fair given its steady-state margin expectation of 3.8% of NMV. The price target of Rs 169 implies a multiple of about 1.2x FY28 EV to NMV, at a modest discount to Blinkit’s estimated multiple of around 1.4%. Within Morgan Stanley’s internet coverage universe, Meesho ranks in the middle of its preference list.What do analysts like?Meesho has built significant scale in the value e-commerce segment since its inception in 2015.

"ECM pipeline strong, rupee likely oversold say Citi bankers","India's equity capital market (ECM) is expected to remain robust in 2026 following a strong pipeline in 2025 led by initial public offers, as private equity firms and foreign controlling shareholders look to cash out, taking advantage of high valuations in the market, top bankers from Citibank said on Thursday.The rupee, which touched record lows in 202,5 is also likely ""oversold"" due to the uncertainty of US tariffs and is likely to regain its losses during the year, the bankers said without giving a level for the rupee.Rob Chan, head of ECM syndicate for Asia at Citi, said he expects the IPO market to be ""very active"" in 2026.""Valuations are high, which will lead to ECM activity with a lot of private equity, shareholder promoters and foreign controlling shareholders likely to cash in.

A case for rethinking Sebi’s new merchant banking rules,"In my article of September 17, 2024, “SEBI’s proposed merchant banking regulations, will it make the big, bigger?”, I dealt at length with the unintended and potentially adverse impact of the proposed changes. SEBI has now notified the amended Merchant Banking Regulations, followed by a detailed circular setting out how the new framework will be implemented from January 3, 2026.Taken together, these represent the most far-reaching rework of India’s merchant banking regulations since 1992. With the consultation process now concluded and the framework formally in place, the discussion inevitably shifts from regulatory intent to how these changes are likely to reshape the industry in practice. Even so, I make one more attempt to sincerely urge a re-review of these changes.Merchant banking regulations in India were framed in a very different market context. The merchant banker of the 1990s was closer to a balance-sheet underwriter, absorbing risk in relatively shallow capital markets. Today’s merchant banker, by contrast, operates more like a transaction architect, where judgement, execution capability and credibility matter far more than deployable capital.At present, 238 registered merchant bankers are operating in a far more institutionalised ecosystem. Their role has evolved towards advisory-led activities across the transaction lifecycle, spanning IPOs, pre-IPO and private capital raises, mergers and acquisitions, buybacks, delistings and other complex capital market transactions.While SEBI has attempted to introduce some flexibility compared to the original proposals, the broader concerns remain largely unaddressed. I am perplexed by the rationale for these changes, particularly at a time when the country is moving towards a low-touch regulatory regime. Further, there have been no major market disruptions, failures or systemic risks that would warrant such sweeping regulatory intervention.Live EventsApart from several operational challenges, two substantive issues",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/a-case-for-rethinking-sebis-new-merchant-banking-rules/articleshow/126544189.cms,economictimes,2026-01-22,neutral
Top 10 smallcap stocks tumble up to 20% in 2026. Is your portfolio at risk?,"After a bruising 2025, when the Nifty Smallcap 100 index fell nearly 6%, 2026 is shaping up to be another difficult year, at least judging by January’s early trend.

Here are 10 stocks that have led the sell-off in the index at the start of the new year. The cigarette maker has emerged as the worst performer in the space, plunging 20%, amid heightened regulatory and policy scrutiny. Cigarette taxes are expected to rise by 38% to 50%, depending on cigarette length, with longer king-sized variants facing a steeper increase. This translates into a weighted-average tax hike of around 40% to 42%. The stock has dropped 14% so far in 2026, after slipping 6% in 2025. The company operates in the energy technology space, offering solutions across electrification, automation and digitalisation for homes, buildings, data centres, infrastructure and industries, with a focus on energy management. Shares of the infrastructure major are down 12.5% in 2026.

Shares of the home textiles exporter have slipped 10.22% in 2026.

"Why today’s market holiday sparked a Street debate: Shankar Sharma, Nithin Kamath, Samir Arora react","India’s stock markets going dark for a local municipal election has triggered an unusually sharp debate among the country’s most influential market voices, reopening an uncomfortable question: how global is India’s stock market mindset, really?The BSE and NSE remained shut on Monday (January 15) due to the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) elections, a decision that immediately drew scrutiny because of the exchanges’ growing international linkages andforeign investor participation. While trading desks stayed idle, the commentary on X was anything but.ZerodhaCo-founder and CEONithin Kamathset the tone with a pointed critique, framing the closure as a structural failure rather than a one-off inconvenience. “Indian stock exchanges are closed today for Mumbai's municipal elections,” Kamath wrote, calling the move “poor planning” and a “serious lack of appreciation for second-order effects.”Kamath went further, questioning the incentive framework behind such decisions. Quoting Charlie Munger, he said:“Show me the incentive, and I will show you the outcome.”According to Kamath, the holiday persists because “no one who matters has any incentive to oppose the market holiday,” adding that it underlines “how far we have to go beforeglobal investorstake us seriously.”That global-investor lens was echoed, albeit from a different angle, by Helios Capital’sSamir Arora. Arora pushed back on the idea that the holiday is inconsequential, raising questions around consistency and fairness for overseas participants.Live Events“So if it does not matter to anyone who does it matter to,” Arora wrote, warning against selective logic around trading days.I don't follow why this closure thing is so bad: three clear positives:1.

Metal stocks surge up to 18% in 2026: Top 6 gainers powering the rally. How many in your portfolio?,"Riding a powerful mix of global and domestic tailwinds, the Nifty Metal index has emerged as the joint-best performer so far in calendar year 2026, climbing 4.5%. Record-high silver prices, tightening copper supply chains, India’s safeguard duty and a renewed capex push have lifted investor appetite for metal stocks. Here are the six stocks that have driven the rally this year. Shares of the company have risen 18% to become the best performer on the Nifty Metal index. Aluminium prices in global markets are trading at the highest level in over three years, with prices on the LME crossing $3,100 per tonne for the first time since 2022 earlier this month. The Anil Agarwal-led company has risen 12% in 2026 so far. According to Nuvama Institutional Equities, which has a target price of Rs 806, Vedanta is nearing the completion of regulatory approvals required for its demerger. Strong commodity prices, cost optimisation, and volume growth are expected to reinforce the company’s earlier investment thesis. One of India’s leading copper producers has seen its share price rally over 10% in 2026 alone.

"Infosys shares may jump up to 10% tomorrow if ADR is an indicator. Target prices go up to Rs 2,076","Infosys Ltd, one of India’s leading information technology companies, could see strong buying on Friday, January 16, after several brokerage firms raised their target prices following a positive surprise from the company. Infosys lifted its constant-currency revenue growth guidance for FY26 to 3-3.5%, from the earlier 2-3% band, signalling a clearer improvement in demand conditions.Overnight, Infosys American Depositary Receipts (ADRs) surged 10% following the guidance upgrade.The improved outlook stands out against a challenging backdrop for large-cap Indian IT services companies, which continue to face cautious client spending, slower decision-making cycles, and sustained margin pressures from regulatory and wage-related costs.The optimism came despite a mixed set of quarterly numbers. Infosys reported a 2% year-on-year decline in consolidated net profit to Rs 6,654 crore for the December quarter, compared with Rs 6,806 crore a year earlier, while revenue from operations rose 9% to Rs 45,479 crore.

The adjusted EBIT margin stood at 21.2%, up 20 basis points quarter-on-quarter, but 10 bps below consensus.Margins benefited from tailwinds, including improved realisations from Project Maximus and favourable currency movements, although these were offset by furloughs and increased variable payouts.

Nomura says United Spirits is at the cusp of a developing upcycle; initiates with Buy rating. 3 reasons why,"United Spirits, one of India’s leading alcoholic beverage makers, is at the cusp of a developing upcycle, says international brokerageNomuraafter it initiated coverage with a Buy rating on the counter.With a target price of Rs 1,650, the brokerage implies an upside potential of 23.5% from current market levels. The stock has had a rough start to the year, down 7% already in the first month. Here’s why analysts see a turnaround.Premiumisation tailwinds aheadShifting consumer demographics and preferences towards Prestige & Above (P&A) brands have strengthened United Spirits’ growth profile. Over FY22–25, the company delivered a robust 15% revenue CAGR while lifting the P&A share of its portfolio from 73% to 90% following the rationalisation of lower-end brands. With its portfolio now heavily skewed towards high-growth premium labels, USL is well placed to address gaps in the mid-segment, where its presence remains limited.Backed by Diageo’s parentage, strong brand equity and higher-than-peer marketing investments, the company has ample headroom to capture white spaces in its portfolio, upgrade consumers and drive margin expansion. EBITDA margins have already improved meaningfully, with further scope for gains.Live EventsRegulatory winds turningRecent regulatory easing across key states such as Andhra Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh and Karnataka, alongside the India–UK trade agreement and a steady cadence of innovation, are expected to support volume growth over the medium term. While sharp duty hikes in Maharashtra could trigger some near-term downtrading, the impact is likely to be offset by these broader tailwinds.Importantly, USL’s premium-heavy mix offers resilience against regulatory volatility, insulating the business from adverse shifts.

Tech Mahindra Q3 Preview: Profit set to climb despite one-time labour code charges,"Tech Mahindrais expected to report steadyrevenue performancealong with improvedprofitabilityin the December quarter, supported by margin expansion and cost optimisation measures. As per the average estimates of six brokerages, the company’s revenue is projected to rise by around 7% year-on-year in Q3, while profit after tax is likely to jump about 40% YoY.The estimated PAT growth does not account for any potential impact from labour code-related provisions. However, given the strong scale of growth projected by brokerages, Tech Mahindra is likely to report profit expansion, setting it apart from many of its larger IT peers.Revenue outlook: Modest growth, led by enterprise tractionMost brokerages anticipate that Tech Mahindra’s revenue growth will remain modest on a sequential basis, pointing to a slow and steady recovery rather than a sharp bounce-back. HSBC expects dollar revenue to rise by about 0.5% quarter-on-quarter, even as constant currency movements pose a 30-basis-point headwind.Nomura and Centrum Broking similarly project sequential growth of around 0.4–0.5% in constant currency terms, supported by improving momentum in BFSI, communications, and enterprise segments.Live EventsNuvama is relatively more upbeat, forecasting constant currency growth of approximately 0.7% quarter-on-quarter, aided by a seasonally stronger retail performance and incremental contributions from telecom and manufacturing.Kotak Equities expects 0.5% constant currency growth, supported by retail and the Comviva business, while also flagging signs of gradual stabilisation across key verticals.Margins: Expansion remains the key themeMargin expansion remains the key focus for investors this quarter.

Why 2026 winter is turning harsh for Sensex, Nifty and whether to buy the fear","In the first few trading days of the new year, nearly Rs 8 lakh crore in market capitalisation has been wiped out, marking the worst start to a calendar year for the Indian stock market in a decade. TheSensexand Nifty are down about 2% each, with the total market capitalisation of all BSE-listed companies falling by around Rs 7.6 lakh crore to Rs 468 lakh crore so far in 2026.The immediate pressure point has been global money flows.

"Mumbai poll holiday for BSE, NSE draws flak from Zerodha's Nithin Kamath","Indian stock exchangesremained shut on Thursday, January 15, due to municipal corporation elections in Maharashtra, resulting in a full-day trading holiday across all segments – a move that sparked debate after Zerodha CEONithin Kamathvoiced his concerns on social media.While the day was initially classified as a settlement holiday, exchanges issued revised circulars last week declaring a complete trading halt, citing expected bank closures across the state.Nithin Kamath took to his social media platform X (formerly Twitter) to question the rationale behind halting market operations for a local civic event, especially in a globally connected financial system.Kamath argued that shutting down exchanges with international linkages for a municipal election highlighted poor planning and a lack of consideration for second-order effects.Citing famed investorCharlie Munger, he wrote, “Show me the incentive, and I will show you the outcome,” suggesting that the market holiday persists because no key stakeholders are incentivized to challenge it.Live Events— Nithin0dha (@Nithin0dha)He further added that such moves underscore how far Indian markets still have to go before being taken seriously by global investors.Kamath’s post sparked immediate debate, drawing a response fromSamir Arora, founder of Helios Capital, who questioned the consistency of such arguments.Arora replied on the same platform: “I hope you will say the same thing when the market is open on Sunday, February 1,” referring to the government’s decision to keep markets open on Budget Day despite it falling on a weekend.“If our exchange has international linkages, is it not unfair to foreign investors to have the market open on Sunday?” he added.— Iamsamirarora (@Iamsamirarora)The discussion has put a spotlight on the broader issue of exchange operational planning and its alignment with India’s aspirations to be a globally significant market.Meanwhile, commodity trading on the Multi-Commodity Exchange (MCX) was p",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/mumbai-poll-holiday-for-bse-nse-draws-flak-from-zerodha-co-founder-nithin-kamath/articleshow/126538141.cms,economictimes,2026-01-22,neutral
"Bharat Coking Coal IPO listing delayed: Check revised allotment, refund and listing timeline","The listing of Bharat Coking Coal, a subsidiary of Coal India, has been postponed due to municipal elections in Maharashtra. Investors will now have to wait three more days for the stock to debut on the exchanges.

"Crude oil takes centre stage amid geopolitical storms, can it still offer investment opportunities?","As geopolitical tensions deepen, with flashpoints emerging across Venezuela, Iran, and Ukraine, crude oil has once again taken centre stage in global markets. The environment has become increasingly unpredictable, shaped by political instability, sanctions, and disruptions to global supply chains.Against this backdrop, oil prices have remained volatile, driven more by risk premiums than by traditional demand-supply fundamentals.According to Ross Maxwell, Global Strategy Operations Lead at VT Markets, crude oil is expected to remain range-bound, with sharp volatility spikes triggered by headlines. Slowing global growth may cap the upside, while geopolitical turmoil provides a floor, making oil a tactical, not linear, investment opportunity.He notes that oil may not deliver consistent returns, but can offer resilience and diversification during periods of stress.Manoj Kumar Jain of Prithvifinmart Commodity Research echoes this outlook, stating that recent geopolitical developments, such as the capture of the Venezuelan President, new trade sanctions against Iran, and ongoing tensions between Russia and Ukraine, have keptcrude oil pricesvolatile, though they may trade with a “positive bias”.Live EventsJain expects WTI crude to test levels between $68 and $74 per barrel, with $54 acting as a strong support on the lower end. In the domestic market, he seesMCX crudeconsolidating in the range of Rs 5,000 to Rs 5,400, with Rs 4,980 serving as a critical support zone.Data from 2025 reveals that crude oil closed the year with a sharp decline of over 15% in Indian markets, one of the worst performances among non-agricultural commodities. Despite this, Jain remains optimistic about a technical base forming in the first half of 2026, supported by the potential revival of global demand, easing trade tariffs, and accommodative US monetary policy.What should investors do now?In light of these dynamics, Ross Maxwell recommends that investors avoid direct exposure to crude as a commo",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/crude-oil-takes-centre-stage-amid-geopolitical-storms-can-it-still-offer-investment-opportunities/articleshow/126537656.cms,economictimes,2026-01-22,neutral

An emerging markets supercycle has just begun: Shuli Ren,"Areemerging marketsjust a one-trick pony? After a stellar 2025, risk-averseinvestorsare getting cautious. After all, this asset class has been an underdog for such a long time. Since 2010, the benchmarkMSCI Emerging Markets Indexhas not outperformed its US counterpart for two consecutive years.BloombergTradersshould keep calm and carry on. There are good reasons to believe that emerging markets have entered a yearslong supercycle. The mechanisms that underpinned 2025’s outperformance, such as a weak dollar, benign globaleconomic growthand investors’ desire to diversify internationally, continue to be present. But more importantly, new investment possibilities are opening up following an eventful January.First, is it time to stockpile commodities? If one consequence of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine is central banks building up gold reserves and diversifying from Treasuries, then President Donald Trump’s oil grab in Venezuela and subsequent threats to take minerals-rich Greenland “the hard way” will only firm up countries’ urge to boost inventories needed for high-end manufacturing, such as robotics and electric vehicles, as well as AI data centers. Indeed, the more bellicose Trump gets, the stronger gold, silver, copper, or nickel rally.It’s a bullish signal for the resource-rich Global South if everyone wants more of these future-facing commodities. Historically, the stock performance of Chile, the world’s top copper producer, is closely linked to the metal’s price. By the same token, Brazil’s market valuation tracks that of industrial metals and South Africa’s to gold.BloombergSecond, new frontiers are emerging. Just two weeks ago, it was inconceivable that Venezuela, once a big borrower in the global sovereign bond market that defaulted on its obligations in 2017 after US-imposed sanctions, could be back in the fold.

Elsewhere, gains in Treasuries pushed the 30-year yield to the lowest level this year.Asian shareshave outpaced gains on Wall Street this year on relatively cheaper valuations and optimism over the artificial-intelligence trade.

"US, Europe dominate FPI flows, Singapore & Mauritius lose out","Mumbai: Overseas capital in Indian equities has undergone a structural shift in the past decade, with foreign portfolio investors domiciled in the US and Europe steadily displacing vehicles from traditional tax-friendly jurisdictions. Data from ICICI Securities showed US-based FPIs accounted for 44% ofFPI equity assetsin India as of December, as against 34% a decade ago. European centres, such as Ireland and Norway, have also seen a consistent increase in their share of India-focused assets. The share of foreign equity assets from Mauritius, which was a dominant route through which foreign capital flowed into India, has declined to 4.1% in 2025 from 21% in 2015.The shift has been driven by tighter tax norms and stricter regulatory disclosures, which have reduced the advantage of routing flows through tax-friendly jurisdictions such as Mauritius and Singapore.Global funds routed money through Mauritius because these countries had tax treaties giving these countries exclusive right to capital gains taxation. ""This changed in 2017 when India amended the tax treaty where it now has the right to tax sale of Indian shares by entities of Mauritius and Singapore,"" said Amit Maheshwari, tax partner, AKM Global.

Tiger Global's treaty 'abuse' case key to how money flows to India,"Mumbai: Overseas strategic investors, offshore private equity and venture capital houses, and foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) active in derivatives have their fingers crossed on the possible outcome of the much-awaitedSupreme Court verdicton the American investment firm Tiger Global (TG) which faces a huge tax demand from India. The crucial judgement which was reserved for months would determine how international investors from Mauritius, Singapore and other treaty countries that serve as key gateways for foreign capital, play and structure their long bets on India stories.DIRECT & INDIRECT TRANSFERThe high-stake feud has its origin in 2018 when TG had sold shares it owned in Flipkart Singapore (which held stocks of Flipkart India) to another foreign investor linked to Walmart. The Flipkart Singapore shares were held by TG entities in Mauritius-which, like Singapore, has a tax treaty with India. Nocapital gains taxwas paid as it was an 'indirect transfer': no shares of Flipkart India was 'directly' transferred; instead TG Mauritius sold shares of Flipkart Singapore which controlled Flipkart India. Under the treaties, investors from treaty jurisdictions are spared capital gains tax for indirect transfer of Indian assets.However, the I-T department questioned the arrangement on the grounds that TG Mauritius was only a vehicle used to escape tax by taking advantage of the treaty. Insisting that TG Mauritius lacked 'substance', the tax office raised a demand of ₹14,500 crore (over $1.7 billion as per today's exchange rate), tossing aside the tax residency certificate (TRC) that TG had received from the Mauritian authorities. This put a question mark on the adequacy of TRC foreign investors use to plan tax.Live EventsThe dispute has now reached a climax.

"UBS cuts EBITDA estimates for Eternal, Swiggy for next 2-3 years. Here's why","UBS has cut adjusted EBITDA estimates forEternal(Zomato) by 10-18% and forSwiggyby 12-28% for the next two to three fiscal years, citing intensifying competition in India's quick commerce sector that is delaying margin recovery. The analyst revisions mark a significant challenge for both platforms as they battle for market share in a segment characterized by increasingly aggressive discounting.The deterioration in margin outlook stems from a notable intensification in competitive pressure that has persisted since September 2025 and continues into January 2026. UBS's pricing tracker shows discounts have widened by 200-300 basis points compared to September levels and have further increased in January 2026 versus November 2025.Amazon and Zepto have emerged as the most aggressive discounters among online platforms, offering the highest promotional incentives while Blinkit continues to maintain relatively lower discount levels, though still elevated compared to earlier periods. This competitive dynamic reflects the intense battle for market share in India's quick commerce space, where customer acquisition through aggressive pricing has become a standard strategy.Margin Recovery Timeline ExtendedThe most significant impact of UBS's downward revision is the pushback in when the sector achieves sustainable margin improvement. For Eternal's Blinkit division, UBS forecasts the quick commerce unit to reach breakeven in FY27 (versus FY26 previously), a critical inflection point that has now been delayed by a fiscal year.

"Budget 2026 to double down on defence? Motilal Oswal flags capex winners, yield risks ahead of FY27","India’s upcoming Union Budget is expected to send a pointed signal to markets. The government is likely to press ahead with defence-led capital spending even as it tightens fiscal discipline and resists calls for tax giveaways. A budget preview by Motilal Oswal suggests the February 1 exercise will prioritise defence and allied industries, infrastructure-linked manufacturing, power, electronics, pharmaceuticals and critical minerals, while keeping a tight lid on revenue expenditure and relying heavily on dividends from the Reserve Bank of India to balance the books.The brokerage expects the gross fiscal deficit to edge down to 4.3% of GDP in FY27 from 4.4% in FY26, marking what it calls a historic shift towards using debt-to-GDP as the primary fiscal anchor. The budget, it said, is likely to be framed around a nominal GDP growth assumption of about 10.1%, providing limited headroom to support growth without undermining consolidation.Capex over populismMotilal Oswal does not expect any populist measures or direct tax changes in the coming budget, arguing that the government’s focus remains firmly on medium-term credibility. Capital expenditure is forecast to rise 10.3% year on year to Rs 12.4 trillion in FY27, holding steady at around 3.1% of GDP, even as revenue spending growth moderates.Defence and allied industries are expected to dominate the capex push. The brokerage notes that the Defence Acquisition Council has already approved capital acquisition proposals worth Rs 790 billion in its winter session, taking FY26 year-to-date approvals to about Rs 3.3 trillion, nearly double the budgeted defence capital outlay for the year. Other sectors expected to see continued policy support include nuclear energy, electronics manufacturing, power, pharmaceuticals and strategic investments linked to critical minerals.Live EventsBeyond traditional infrastructure, the brokerage highlighted digital technologies embedded in agriculture, healthcare and social sectors, as well as ",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/budget-2026-to-double-down-on-defence-motilal-oswal-flags-capex-winners-yield-risks-ahead-of-fy27/articleshow/126519121.cms,economictimes,2026-01-22,neutral
"Will Budget revive capex stocks? What defence, rail and infra investors should watch","The upcoming UnionBudgeton February 1 is shaping up as a litmus test for the capex trade, which has lost momentum over the past year. After a sharp front-loading of government capital spending in the first half of FY26, execution has normalised, valuations have reset, and investors are now looking for policy signals that could extend, or decisively cap, the cycle.Dalal Street expectations suggest the government is likely to stick to fiscal discipline, leaving limited headroom for a broad-based capex push. With the fiscal deficit trajectory largely locked and tax collections under pressure, any incremental spending is expected to be selective rather than expansive. This shifts the focus from headline numbers to sectoral allocation and intent, with defence, railways, and a handful of infrastructure-linked segments likely to absorb a disproportionate share of attention.Defence appears best positioned, supported by emergency procurement in FY26, sustained indigenisation push and a likely step-up in allocations for allied industries. Railways, particularly safety, signalling and rolling stock, remain in favour, even as broader infra segments such as roads and housing risk seeing flatter allocations.Defence stands out as the clear winner. Emergency procurement added Rs 40,000 crore in FY26, and Motilal Oswal expects defence spending to jump 15% in FY27 from an estimated Rs 1.8 lakh crore base. Allied industries, shipbuilding, electronics, and critical minerals, are set to ride the indigenisation wave as the government doubles down on strategic resilience.Railways will hold ground, but only in pockets: Safety, signalling, and rolling stock remain priorities. The rest—roads, housing, and broader rail segments that made up 47% of FY26's capex allocation—face a subdued outlook. BofA Securities’s economists Rahul Bajoria and Smriti Mehra warn that “allocation could continue to remain subdued for Roads, Railways (remaining sub-segments) and Housing.”Live EventsCapex growth itse",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/will-budget-revive-capex-stocks-what-defence-rail-and-infra-investors-should-watch/articleshow/126518763.cms,economictimes,2026-01-22,neutral

"Nomura initiates coverage on ITC Hotels, IHCL with Buy rating. Check target price, upside potential","International brokerage firm Nomura has initiated coverage on two hospitality stocks -ITC Hotelsand Tata Group-ownedIndian Hotels Company(IHCL), with a Buy rating citing robust growth prospects in the coming quarters.With a price target of Rs 230 forITCHotels, analysts imply an upside potential of 20% from current market levels. For Indian Hotels, the foreign brokerage has pegged the target at Rs 830, forecasting an upside potential of over 22% from the previous close of Rs 678.For ITC, Nomura cites strong visibility on high single-digit growth in revenue per available room (RevPAR), driven by resilient average room rate growth and improving occupancy at recently opened assets. The brokerage expects continued RevPAR gains to translate into meaningful operating margin expansion and a stronger cost structure, bringing the company closer to peers in the luxury hospitality segment.Nomura also sees scope for improvement in return on invested capital asITC Hotelsexpands room inventory through its managed-keys strategy and as its Sri Lanka assets, including ITC Ratnadipa and Sapphire Residences, gain traction. Overall, Nomura forecasts consolidated revenue and EBITDA CAGRs of 15% and 18% respectively, over FY25–FY28, along with robust annual cash generation of Rs 800-1,000 crore, which could support inorganic growth opportunities. The stock is valued at 23x FY28 EV/EBITDA, implying a 10% discount to theIndian Hotelscompany, which trades at 26x FY28 EV/EBITDA.As for IHCL, Nomura says average daily rate (ADR) growth is supported by robust demand and a relatively low ADR base in dollar terms. The brokerage also highlights improving the quality of earnings and return on invested capital as IHCL expands largely through management fee arrangements and its capital-light Ginger model.

FII holding in Eternal declines for 7th straight quarter. Is recent correction a buying opportunity?,"Foreign institutional investor holding inEternalhas steadily declined over the past seven quarters, reflecting a combination of regulatory decisions and index-related flows in India’s new-age internet stock. Data from Trendlyne shows thatFIIownership has fallen from 54% in June 2024 to 36.2% by December 2025, marking a sharp and uninterrupted reduction in foreign shareholding.This seven-quarter slide coincides with a key strategic decision taken by Eternal’s board in April 2025, when it approved capping foreign ownership at 49.5% to maintain the company’s status as an Indian-Owned and Controlled Company under FEMA regulations. The move was aimed at ensuring regulatory flexibility for Eternal’s fast-growing quick commerce business, Blinkit.Under domestic FDI rules, e-commerce platforms with majority foreign ownership, defined as more than 50%, are not permitted to hold inventory and can only operate through the marketplace model. Retaining IOCC status allows Eternal to shift Blinkit to an inventory-led business model, under which the company can stock its own inventory rather than merely facilitating transactions between sellers and consumers.Operating an inventory-led model gives the company tighter control over product assortment, supply chains and pricing, while also enabling better margin management. Over time, this could translate into improved profitability, especially in a segment where speed, availability and unit economics play a critical role.However, the decision to cap foreign ownership mechanically reduces the room available for foreign investors, which partly explains the steady decline in FII holding over successive quarters.Live EventsRecent correction a buying window?While FII holding has been falling, recent brokerage commentary suggests that sentiment on Eternal’s stock may be stabilising after a sharp correction. Shares of Eternal, which operatesZomatoand Blinkit, have declined around 25% from its record high of Rs 368 it clinched in October 2025,",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/fii-holding-in-eternal-declines-for-7th-straight-quarter-is-recent-correction-a-buying-opportunity/articleshow/126517735.cms,economictimes,2026-01-22,neutral
Did Kotak Mahindra Bank shares really tank 80%? Here’s why investors do not need to panic,"Kotak Mahindra Bankshares saw a sharp decline of over 80% in early trade on Wednesday, hitting their day’s low of Rs 425.05 on the BSE. But before investors jump to conclusions, the dramatic fall in the stock price is not linked to the bank’s fundamentals.Instead, it's the result of a technical price adjustment as the stock tradedex-splitfollowing its recently announced 5:1 stock split.As per the corporate action, Kotak Mahindra Bank has subdivided each Rs 5 share into five shares of face value Rs 1. The record date for determining eligible shareholders was set for today, January 14, and the stock also began trading ex-split.This change effectively increases the number of outstanding shares in circulation by five times while reducing the face value per share. Accordingly, the share price gets adjusted downward to reflect the revised capital structure, without impacting the company’s market capitalisation or shareholder wealth.To break it down: if a shareholder owned 50 shares before the split, they would now hold 250 shares post-split. If the share was priced at Rs 1,800 before the split, it would now trade at approximately Rs 360 per share, leaving the total value of the investment unchanged.Live EventsAlso read:Mukul Agrawal reshapes Rs 6,500-crore portfolio in Q3: Two new stocks, one exit.

Credit cooperative societies with a minimum capital of ₹300 crore,capital adequacy ratioabove 12%, netnon-performing loansbelow 3% and sound track records for five years would qualify.The proposal, outlined in a Reserve Bank of India (RBI) discussion paper published on Monday, marks the first step toward reopening UCB licensing after a pause of more than two decades.The RBI said the move aims to strengthen governance and financial resilience in the sector, which has historically faced challenges such as weak capital structures, governance lapses, and technology gaps.The paper argues that only large, well-managedcooperative credit societiesbe considered for conversion into UCBs. These entities must demonstrate at least 10 years of active operations and a progressive financial performance over the immediately preceding five years.The RBI also emphasised that governance standards for UCBs mirror those for commercial banks, requiring professional and independent boards.Live EventsStatutory amendments to State and Multi-State Cooperative Acts may be necessary to enforce these norms.

RBI's likely to hold interest rates with inflation set to rise,"MUMBAI: The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) is expected to keep itsrepo rateunchanged in its February policy meeting as the central bank would likely wait for parameters that would determine inflation and growth prints in the new base-year series, economists said. This new series, which rolls out from next month, is expected to shift the growth-inflation dynamics as weights that constitute the consumption basket are expected to change to reflect the latest wallet shares of today's needs.Themonetary policy committee(MPC) is set to meet February 4-6, in the same week after the finance minister presents the Union budget.With the December consumer inflation print of 1.33%, Q3 inflation averaged 0.8%. That was 20 bps higher than the RBI's Q3 forecast of 0.6%. Economists believe the RBI will see a similar upside to its Q4 forecast too, which is at 2.9%. The RBI has cumulatively cut policy rates 125 basis points sinceFebruary 2025 to 5.25%.""We do not foresee any further rate cuts for now, as inflation could be above 4% four quarters down,"" said Dhiraj Nim, economist and FX Strategist, ANZ Bank. ""However, durable liquidity infusions are needed both to bring up reserve money growth and ease the prevailing upward pressure on borrowing costs.""Live EventsLooking ahead, economists expect the RBI to inject additional liquidity through open market operations (OMO) to keep systemic liquidity in surplus. With retail inflation projected to rise above 4% after four quarters, policy rates are widely expected to remain on hold during upcoming MPC meetings, shifting market focus to the scale and timing of liquidity support.System liquidity turned deficit in the second half of December and has been in a tight surplus of Rs 36,869 crore on average in January so far, as per RBI data. Soumya Kanti Ghosh, chief economic advisor atState Bank of India(SBI), expects about Rs 2 lakh crore of OMO in the remainder of FY26 and a similar trend in the next fiscal too.

""Regulatory processes must evolve towards proactive detection and agile interventions without sacrificing prudence and quality of judgement.""Murmu flagged five major challenges for regulators in the digital era, starting with the speed of technological change. ""New applications and business models are emerging with increasing frequency, challenging the appropriateness and speed ofregulatory response,"" he said.He also cautioned that digitalisation is blurring traditional regulatory boundaries, creating fragmented oversight. ""Many financial activities are now being unbundled and delivered through non-financial platforms... no single authority has a comprehensive, end-to-end view of the entire activity chain,"" Murmu noted.Indicating that prescriptive rules risk becoming obsolete as technologies evolve, while principle-based frameworks can lead to uneven application. ""The challenge lies in calibrating regulation to have clarity without rigidity and flexibility without ambiguity,"" he said.Live EventsSystemic risks from innovations such as cloud and decentralised finance are another concern. ""Fragility can emerge without any single entity appearing vulnerable... regulators must look beyond entity-level soundness to systemic effects,"" Murmu warned.Cybersecurityand operational resilience remain critical.

The oil-to-telecom conglomerate is scheduled to announce its December-quarter (Q3FY26) results on Friday, January 16. Can investors buy this dip?What do technicals indicate?“Reliance Industries is currently undergoing a corrective phase after posting a new record high near the Rs 1,610 mark, with the stock slipping below its short-term 20-day and medium-term 100-day exponential moving averages, signalling a loss of near-term momentum,” says Ajit Mishra, SVP atReligareBroking.Mishra believes this decline is part of a healthy consolidation within a broader uptrend rather than a trend reversal. Volumes during the pullback remain moderate, suggesting the absence of panic selling. The Rs 1,380–1,440 zone is expected to provide strong support, while the Rs 1,520–1,600 band is likely to act as a near-term resistance. Investors with a medium-to-long-term horizon may consider using this phase to accumulate on declines near the support zone.Echoing the same view, Aakash Shah Technical Research Analyst at Choice Equity Broking saidReliance Industriesis currently witnessing a healthy pullback within its broader uptrend. After a strong rally from the October lows, the stock faced rejection near the Rs 1,580–1,600 resistance zone and has retraced toward its key moving averages.

"India’s new labour codes could wipe out up to a fifth of IT profits, Jefferies warns","India’s $250 billion information technology industry is bracing for a potentially sharp earnings shock from the rollout of the country’s new labour codes, with Jefferies warning that December-quarter profits could fall by as much as 10%–20% and margins could remain under sustained pressure thereafter, even as it reiterates selective buy calls on stocks such asInfosys,HCL Technologies,Coforge,Mphasis,Sagilityand IKS.Jefferies said the consolidation of 29 labour laws into four new codes, effective November 2025, will materially alter how employee compensation and benefits are calculated, forcing IT companies to recognise sharply higher gratuity and leave-encashment liabilities in the December quarter. The brokerage estimates that contributions linked to gratuity, provident fund and leave encashment could rise by 27%–70%, resulting in a one-time hit to profits.“The increase will be recognised as a one-time impact in Dec-25 results,” Jefferies said, adding that the impact at the lower end could still erode 10%–20% of quarterly profits across the sector.Structural rise in employee costsBeyond the one-off adjustment, Jefferies warned of a structural increase in employee costs. Under the new wage code, “wages” will become the base for calculating statutory benefits and must account for at least 50% of an employee’s cost-to-company, compared with roughly 30%–40% under the current regime. Companies will also have to allow annual encashment of leave exceeding 30 days and extend gratuity benefits to fixed-term employees after one year, instead of five.Live EventsAs a result, the brokerage estimates that in-hand salaries could fall by 4%–6% if firms continue to contribute 12% of wages to provident fund. While companies may opt for a lower statutory PF contribution of Rs21,600 a year, Jefferies cautioned that this may not fully offset the pressure, particularly at junior levels.Citing an Aon survey, Jefferies noted that about two-thirds of IT firms expect employee costs to rise ",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/indias-new-labour-codes-could-wipe-out-up-to-a-fifth-of-it-profits-jefferies-warns/articleshow/126501714.cms,economictimes,2026-01-22,neutral

In the early hours, the subscription stood at just 4%, with 9.73 lakh shares bid against the 2.72 crore shares on offer.The IPO is seeing a grey market premium (GMP) of around 4%, signalling modest expectations for listing gains amid a volatile broader equity market and increased scrutiny of valuations in new-age tech offerings.The issue is coming at a time when primary market sentiment is selective, with investors increasingly distinguishing between cash-generating businesses and high-growth but loss-making platforms.Amagi Media Labs IPO subscription statusOn the first day of its IPO, as of 12:20 PM, Amagi Media Labs’ issue was subscribed just 3% overall, indicating a slow start.Live EventsRetail Individual Investors (RIIs) showed relatively stronger interest, subscribing 15% of the 50.73 lakh shares allocated to them.Non-Institutional Investors (NIIs) subscribed only 2% of their 76.09 lakh shares, reflecting tepid participation from this segment.Qualified Institutional Buyers (QIBs) have not yet placed any bids for the 1.45 crore shares reserved for them, suggesting cautious sentiment among large institutional players.This early subscription pattern points to selective investor interest, with retail investors showing some confidence while institutional participation remains subdued.Amagi Media Labs IPO GMP todayAccording to unofficial market sources, the grey market premium (GMP) for Amagi Media Labs’ IPO is around 4%, translating to Rs 16 over the issue price of Rs 361. This is a relatively cautious signal compared with the double-digit premiums typically seen during stronger primary market cycles.Based on this, the IPO’s estimated listing price is around Rs 377.

"CLSA flags margin recovery ahead for HDFC Bank, predicts 27% headroom despite weak start to the year","Global brokerageCLSAhas maintained its “Outperform” rating onHDFC Bank, projecting a potential upside of over 27% from current levels, even as the stock remains under pressure in the short term. The brokerage has set atarget priceof Rs 1,200 on the stock, which is currently trading near Rs 943.50 on the BSE, after falling 6.2% from its January high of Rs 1,006.30.Addressing investor concerns around slower deposit growth and the lack of immediate margin improvement post-merger, CLSA believes these issues are either temporary or misunderstood.It expects FY27 to be a ""bounce-back year"" for the bank, supported by improving operating dynamics and cost rationalisation.Valuations, according to CLSA, are now attractive, with HDFC Bank trading at a 10–12% price-to-book (PB) discount toICICI Bank. The brokerage believes this valuation gap may not be justified in the long term, especially as cost discipline improves.Core operating expenses (opex) are expected to grow at 5–7% year-on-year, compared to 10% growth in loans. CLSA adds that slower hiring and reallocation of staff to customer-facing roles are signs of operational tightening.Live EventsThe brokerage forecasts HDFC Bank’s core pre-provision operating profit (PPOP) to grow at high-teens levels over the next two years, supported by operational efficiency and loan book expansion. Althoughreturn on equity(ROE) is currently lower than ICICI Bank’s, CLSA notes that at 1.7x FY28 PB, the risk-reward for HDFC Bank appears “extremely favourable.”HDFC Bank share price historyOver the past six months, the stock of HDFC Bank has seen a decline of 4.74%, reflecting a gradual downward drift in sentiment.

Ixigo shares set for 30% upside? 4 reasons JM Financial upgraded stock to Buy,"The parent company of online travel aggregatorIxigo, Le Travenues Technology's share--- jumped over 7% to an intraday high of Rs 227.50 on January 13 afterJM Financialupgraded the stock to ‘Buy’ and raised its target price to Rs 275 per share. The brokerage’s target implies an upside potential of about 30% from current levels.Here’s the 4 reason driving the bullish outlook:Attractive valuations: In a statement the domestic brokerage said that the recent correction in the stock, down about 20% since early December, appears overdone. While it trimmed its FY26–28E consolidated revenue estimates by 1–4% and EBITDA margins by 22–34 basis points—leading to a 5–7% cut in FY26–28E EBITDA—it believes the recent price decline has largely addressed valuation concerns. The correction, it added, offers an attractive long-term entry point, with the stock now factoring in near-term uncertainties more than warranted while underappreciating its structural strengths and recovery potential.Long term fundamentals remain intact: JM hopes that online travel agencies (OTAs) to benefit from structural tailwinds in India’s travel ecosystem, including improving infrastructure, better connectivity and rising affordability. These drivers are especially strong in tier-2 and smaller cities, where travel demand is growing faster than in tier-1 markets, supported by enhanced multi-modal connectivity. “We believe Ixigo is well positioned to capitalise on these trends over the medium to long term, given its strong brand recall in these markets, effective cross-selling across apps, consistent focus on customer experience and strong adoption of differentiated value-added offerings such as Travel Guarantee, Ixigo Assured and Abhi Assured,"" JM said in a statement.Air disruption overdone: Air industry disruption, primarily in the first half of December 2025, is not a structural issue for OTAs as underlying passenger demand remains strong. Moreover, as stability returns, Ixigo should revert to growing fas",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/ixigo-shares-set-for-30-upside-4-reasons-jm-financial-upgraded-stock-to-buy/articleshow/126498461.cms,economictimes,2026-01-22,neutral
"Buy or sell? What TCS, HCL Tech results mean for IT stocks after Rs 75,000 crore FII selloff","WhileTCSandHCL Techshares were trading little changed on Tuesday post theirQ3 resultsannounced on Monday, brokerages and market strategists are increasingly debating whether the combination of earnings trends, valuation support, and demand signals warrants a tactical buy or continued caution amid a deep Rs 75,000-croreFII selloffin 2025 that has left the sector among the year’s worst-hit.Brokerages tracking the Q3 numbers suggest the sector’s outlook hinges on a delicate balance between structural demand shifts and near-term execution.Jefferiesnoted that TCS’s quarter delivered largely in-line revenue with muted margin performance and limited evidence of a meaningful pick-up in international growth. Productivity gains embedded in contract renewals, while helpful for efficiency, are expected to temper topline momentum as clients push for 10–15% efficiency improvements, leading the firm to maintain a Hold rating with a revised target of Rs 3,485.By contrast, analysts at Jefferies andEmkayseeHCL Technologies’ results as relatively more resilient. Emkay highlighted that HCL Tech posted better-than-expected revenue and margin outcomes, supported by strong net new deal wins and expanding AI-linked revenues. Jefferies expects HCL Tech to deliver the highest recurring EPS compound annual growth among India’s top five IT firms over FY26–28, underpinning a Buy view with a rolled-over target price.This nuanced backdrop of modest growth, pricing pressure, persistent geopolitical and discretionary spend headwinds, but pockets of structural AI demand has shaped market commentary around the notion of an inflection point, not as a consensus buy signal, but as a juncture where stock-specific execution and demand traction, rather than broad sector momentum, will likely drive performance.HCL Technologies delivered the quarter's standout performance, posting better-than-expected revenue and margin outcomes that have prompted bullish calls from key brokerages.

"Meesho’s 129% post-IPO rally fizzles as stock slides 35% from peak amid valuation concerns. Buy, sell or hold?","Meesho’s seven-session multibagger rally, which saw the stock surge 129% over its IPO price, has hit a speed bump, with shares slipping 35% from the peak amid valuation concerns, the expiry of the anchor lock-in period, and a senior management reshuffle. Adding to the pressure, cautious commentary from brokerages and analysts is capping any runaway upside in an otherwise weak market environment.Listed on December 10 at a premium of 46%, Meesho's significant rally led its share price to soar to Rs 254.40, and it has been on a downward trend since then. The stock fell to its low of Rs 153.89 and is now in recovery mode.Abhinav Tiwari, Research Analyst at Bonanza, attributes the ongoing pressure on Meesho to the IPO lock-in expiry, which has increased the supply of shares in the market and led to selling by early investors and pre-IPO shareholders. In addition, the stock had been trading at elevated valuation multiples compared to other consumer internet and retail peers, prompting profit-taking.""This lock-in related supply, combined with broader risk-off sentiment toward high valuation new age stocks, has resulted in valuation de-rating, even as the underlying business performance remains largely intact,"" Tiwari said.According to market data, up to 110 million shares, or about 2% of the company’s outstanding equity, have become tradeable.Live EventsIn a recently released note,JM Financialsaid that the stock price has run up sharply, leaving minimal room for error despite the differentiated business model and the company remaining a key player in the Indian e-commerce space.JM Financial's stock valuation based on the discounted cash flows (DCF) yields an equity value of Rs 170 per share, implying a 108x/25x FY28/FY30 EV/adjusted EBITDA multiple.Also Read:After blockbuster 2025, metal stocks tumble up to 10% weekly this year.

Groww shares rise nearly 5% in just two sessions. What’s triggering the rally?,"Shares ofBillionbrains Garage Ventures, the parent company ofGroww, rallied another 2% to their day’s high of Rs 166 on Tuesday, after Kotak Institutional Equities initiated coverage with a Buy rating and a target price of Rs 190 per share. This implies an upside potential of 16.5% from current market levels.The brokerage expects FY26E to see largely flat earnings, followed by strong growth of around 35% in FY27E and about 25% in FY28E. This growth is likely to be driven by a sharp ramp-up in underpenetrated segments such as marginal trading facility (MTF), commodities, incremental contribution from wealth revenues through both organic and inorganic avenues, and operating leverage that should support margin expansion.Groww is expected to deliver a 20% revenue CAGR over FY2026–28E, supported by a business model designed for high profitability. EBITDA margins are likely to expand to around 65% by FY2028E from about 60% in FY2025, driven by scale benefits and a steady decline in cost intensity. Margin expansion will also be supported by new, higher-margin revenue streams such as MTF and commodities.Further, Kotak added that marketing costs, as a percentage of revenue, have fallen sharply to 12% in FY2025 from 21% in FY2023 and are projected to ease further to around 10% by FY2028E. Strong internal cash generation is expected to comfortably fund growth in MTF and on-balance sheet lending, supporting capital efficiency. The balance sheet remains under-leveraged, with a healthy return on equity of around 25%.Groww’s product‑first DNA, organic acquisition engine and tech focus have created a platform that scales faster and monetizes better than peers while continually broadening revenue streams beyond turnover‑linked broking, Kotak said in a note dated January 9. Groww’s journey so far demonstrates consistent share gains across products, pricing power, improving unit economics and a high-potential wealth pivot.

Value buys? Worst-performing India market pushes 25 Nifty stocks below 5-year PE,"After dubbed, world's worst-performing major equity market in 2025, India has begun 2026 too on a fragile footing, rattled by global uncertainty and sustained foreign investor selling. Yet looking beyond the recent volatility, valuation data shows that at least 25 largeNiftystocks are now trading below their own five-year average price-to-earnings multiples.This does not automatically mean the market has turned cheap. But it does mark a shift from the valuation excesses, a sentiment echoed by many brokerages heading into this year.The price-to-earnings ratio compares a company's share price to its earnings per share. A stock trading below its five-year averagePEis valued at a discount to what investors have historically been willing to pay for its earnings. In simple terms, the market is either assuming slower future growth, higher risk, weaker earnings visibility -- or all three.For instance,HDFC Banktrades at a trailing PE of about 19.9 times compared to its five-year average of 20.75. Infosys trades near 23 times versus a five-year average of 27.75.Reliance Industriesis at roughly 24 times against a historical average of 26.6.Even consumer-facing compounders such as Hindustan Unilever, Titan and Asian retail plays like Trent are trading at meaningful discounts to their longer-term valuation bands.Live EventsThe valuation compression of stocks is line poor show of Indian stocks over the last one year. India closed 2025 as the worst-performing major equity market in the world, even as global peers staged powerful rallies. In dollar terms, theSensexand the Nifty50 have delivered returns of just 4-5% in 2025.Foreign investors too have been aggressive sellers in Indian equities over the past one year period.

When foreign funds exit largecap stocks, prices fall faster than earnings estimates adjust, pulling down PE multiples.Does this mean value buying has emerged?Valuation compression is a necessary but not ",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/value-buys-worst-performing-india-market-pushes-25-nifty-stocks-below-5-year-pe/articleshow/126496147.cms,economictimes,2026-01-22,neutral

"Asian shares rise on valuations, dollar declines","Asian shares climbed to near a record, buoyed by optimism over earnings and regional economic growth as investors broadened their focus beyond US markets.TheMSCI Asia Pacific Indexadvanced 0.9% on Wednesday for a second day of gains. Asian shares have outpaced the S&P 500 this year, even as the US benchmark rose 0.2% to close at a record high. Equity-index futures for US stocks declined 0.2% in early Asian trading.Much of the early action was in Japan, where stock gauges jumped after returning from a holiday. The yen gained as much as 0.2% to 157.90 per dollar after Finance Minister Satsuki Katayama said she told US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent that she’s concerned about one-way yen moves. Japanese government bond yields surged amid speculation that Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi might dissolve the parliament as soon as next month.Asian shares, relatively cheaper after three years of gains, face key risks this week fromUS inflation dataand a possible Supreme Court ruling on President Donald Trump’s tariffs. The momentum in stocks suggested investors are looking beyond the US, where renewed attacks by the Trump administration on the Federal Reserve have raised concerns over central-bank independence.“Non-US assets such as European and Asian equities are likely to look more favorable, especially due to cheaper valuations and as US foreign policy becomes more unpredictable,” said David Chao, global market strategist at Invesco Asset Management, which oversees more than $2 trillion.Live EventsAsian shares are cheaper compared with US benchmarks.

Domestic markets bounce back after US ambassador calms trade jitters,"Mumbai: Domestic equity indices notched up gains on Monday in a volatile trading session, snapping a five-day losing streak, after US ambassador to India Sergio Gor's assurance that the two countries will discuss trade issues on Tuesday sparked an immediate revival. Markets had fallen over heightened concerns that theUS-India trade dealwas stuck in the wake of a 500% tariff threat by President Donald Trump and recent comments by commerce secretary Howard Lutnick.The NSE Nifty rose 106.95 points or 0.4% to close at 25,790.25. The BSE Sensex climbed 301.93 points or 0.4% to end at 83,878.17. Both indices recovered by nearly 1.2% from their intraday lows as the diplomat's remarks triggered liquidation of some of the bearish bets. Gor was speaking in New Delhi after arriving in the country to take charge as ambassador, having been picked for the job.Late last week, markets fell as Trump backed a bill allowing 500% tariffs on countries that knowingly engage in the exchange of Russian-origin uranium and petroleum products. This caused the indices to shed 2.5% last week, the biggest weekly loss since September.AgenciesFear Gauge Up 4%""The US ambassador's comments gave the market some relief that both sides are actively engaged in firming up a trade deal,"" said Narendra Solanki, head of fundamental research,Anand Rathi Shareand Stock Brokers Ltd, strengthening expectations of an early conclusion to the trade talks.Live EventsLast week's tariff talk had dashed hopes of an India-US trade deal happening soon, seen as crucial for market revival.Momentum indicators were in the oversold zone technically and that aided the quick recovery, said Rohan Shah, technical analyst atAsit C MehtaInvestment Intermediates.

NSE shares surge after IPO clouds seem to clear,"Mumbai: Shares of National Stock Exchange (NSE) once again climbed above the ₹2,000 mark, surging 6% in unlisted trading on Monday, after the Securities and Exchange Board of India chief's comments over the weekend that the bourse's much-awaited initial public offer will be cleared, possibly in January, rekindled investor interest. The stock ended at ₹2,095 on Monday, according to data from unlistedzone.com. On Friday, they had closed at ₹1,975.Sebi chairperson Tuhin Kanta Pandey said on Saturday said the regulator is at a ""very advanced stage"" of granting the no-objection certificate (NoC) for NSE's IPO, according to ANI.""There has been a pick-up in incremental demand and higher trading volumes in NSE shares over the weekend,"" said Sandip Ginodia, director at Altius Investech, which deals in unlisted shares.NSE shares have been under pressure of late and have mostly stayed below ₹2,000 since September on account of the delay in IPO approval and pressures on profits following Sebi's clampdown on the equity derivatives market.

Banks bank on cash recyclers in new ATM cycle,"Mumbai: ATMs are staging a strong comeback in India, aggressive deployment plans from state-run banks showed, as lenders increasingly pivot towardcash recyclersto boost efficiency and cut operating costs.Over the next six months, up to the first quarter of FY27, banks have floated requests for proposals (RFPs) for nearly 17,350 ATMs, withUnion Bank of India,Bank of India,Canara BankandIndian Banktogether accounting for more than 8,000 machines.What appears to be a contraction in India's ATM base is, in fact, a technology-led transition from conventional ATMs to cash recyclers. Of the total RFPs floated, around 13,100 are for cash recyclers, indicating a strong preference for recycler-led deployments, which account for more than 75% of the planned installations.Among upcoming cash recycler tenders over the next six months, Union Bank of India plans to deploy around 2,000 machines, Bank of India about 3,700, Canara Bank nearly 1,500, and Indian Bank roughly 1,006.""We see a fair bit of bank outsourcing and the RFP cycle coming up again in 2026,"" said Anush Raghavan, chief business officer atCMS Info Systems. ""The last wave of asset replacement or expansion was seen in 2023 and 2024. In 2025, we had an increase in ATM interchange fees, which typically leads to expansion of the market and higher outsourcing. But 2025 was bookended by various disruptions, so we expect 2026 to see more RFPs and greater outsourcing activity.""Live EventsIn 2025, the collapse of one of the largest ATM service providers, AGS Transact-which once operated nearly 40,000 ATMs-forced several banks to either shut down older machines or migrate to new service providers. This transition has accelerated the adoption of newer technologies, particularly cash recyclers, as banks look to ensure continuity of service while lowering cash-handling costs and downtime.An industry executive, who did not wish to be named, said banks are now being far more deliberate in their deployment strategy.

Shriram-MUFG deal may test rules on non-compete fee for promoters,"Mumbai: India’s largest inbound deal in the financial sector involving Japan's biggest lender has put the spotlight on an unusual $200 millionnon-compete fee, potentially setting up a test case for the country’s securities regulations.Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group(MUFG) Bank has agreed to pay the fee to the promoter ofShriram Finance(SFL) as part of a broader investment plan under which the Japanese lender will acquire a 20% stake in the Chennai-based shadow bank for $4.4 billion.The non-compete payment —amounting nearly 5% of the deal value—is intended to prevent Shriram Ownership Trust (SOT), the promoter entity, from launching a rival lending business under the Shriram brand or any other name.Non-compete fees are not uncommon in M&A transactions but are typically paid to promoters who exit a business after selling their stake and relinquishing control, thereby protecting the buyer’s interests. When Holcim acquiredGujarat AmbujaCement (GACL) in 2006, for instance, the Swiss major paid a non-compete fee to promoters Narotam Sekhsaria and Suresh Neotia after they sold out and ceded control. In the case of SFL, SOT will continue as a promoter, retain management control, and remain a significant shareholder even after MUFG comes on board as a strategic investor. Yet, it will receive a non-compete payment—an arrangement that appears unprecedented in India’s M&A history.Questions have been raised by investors and analysts about the need for a separate financial benefit for SOT and why similar terms are not being offered to non-promoter shareholders. India’s market regulator, theSecurities and Exchange Board of India(Sebi), requires that all shareholders receive “equitable treatment” and that promoters not be paid extra amounts “by whatever name it may be called”.Regulation 26(6) of Sebi’s listing rules states that a promoter cannot enter into any agreement with shareholders or third parties to receive compensation or profitsharing from transactions in the company’s sec",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/shriram-mufg-deal-may-test-rules-on-non-compete-fee-for-promoters/articleshow/126494747.cms,economictimes,2026-01-22,neutral
Distribution costs weigh on value of insurance products,"Mumbai: Hefty commissions and rising operating costs are increasingly eroding the value of insurance products, experts said, potentially negating some of the anticipated beneficial impact of zero service taxes on retail products announced in the broadest federal reforms on consumption taxes.Market experts have flagged concerns with credit-linked life policies, non- linked insurance products and motor third party and retail health policies. ""The high cost of operating an insurance company is a huge issue,"" said Avinash Singh, analyst, Emkay Global. ""Insurance distribution cost cannot be determined based on insurers' and distributors' view of their cost structure and profitability goals; rather, the cost of distribution and operations needs to be based on the value delivered by a product to the customer, and such value needs to be either in terms of protection offered or savings returns delivered.""In retail health insurance, higher payouts for new customer acquisition continue, while experts argue that renewal commissions must be sharply reduced to prevent premiums from rising as policyholders age.To be sure, the government waived the goods and services taxes (GST) applicable to retail insurance policies from the third quarter of FY26 in the broadest reforms for the uniform consumption taxes since their introduction in 2017.Concerns are also evident in credit-linked life insurance, where policies meant to protect borrowers and lenders are often bundled into group single-premium products and sold with steep commissions. Because these covers are embedded within group business, commissions are difficult to identify separately.Live EventsMore than a dozen insurance companies exceeded their prescribed expense limit last financial year after the sector regulator removed the product cap on commissions and introduced an overall expense of management cap.Non-linked savings plans are also steadily losing appeal as high costs eat into returns, making them less competitive than o",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/distribution-costs-weigh-on-value-of-insurance-products/articleshow/126494800.cms,economictimes,2026-01-22,neutral

"BofA takes a measured view on Meesho’s next phase, starts coverage with 'neutral' rating; stock sheds 5%","BofA Securities on Monday initiated coverage on newly listed e-commerce firmMeeshowith a Neutral rating and a price target of Rs 190 per share. The brokerage pointed to emerging monetisation drivers in advertising and logistics, while maintaining a measured stance on valuation following the stock’s sharp post-IPO rally.BofA highlighted Meesho’s shift in its advertising model and its approach to logistics as key elements shaping the company’s longer-term outlook. At the same time, the Neutral rating signals caution as the stock transitions from listing-driven momentum to closer scrutiny of execution and valuation.Shares of Meesho fell as much as 5% on Monday to Rs 162.10. The decline followed a 3% rise on Friday, after the stock had slipped for three consecutive sessions.Ads and logistics emerge as key leversBofA flagged advertising as an important monetisation driver, noting Meesho’s move away from a cost-per-click (CPC) model towards a return-on-investment-based approach. According to the report, sellers faced challenges under the CPC model as the “average seller in India didn’t fully understand the CPC product” and ad spends “didn’t lead to conversions.”By contrast, the brokerage said merchants prefer ROI-based advertising, which is “more outcome-driven.” BofA noted that Meesho’s ad engine is along the lines of the “GMVmax” model used by platforms such as TikTok Shop and Shopee, adding that the shift has led to a consistent increase in ad revenues.Live EventsLogistics was identified as the second monetisation driver. BofA said Meesho’s ability to serve value-focused users efficiently stems from its continued efforts to reduce logistics costs. The brokerage noted that Meesho prioritises keeping logistics costs low for sellers rather than extracting profits from its logistics network, a strategy that allows sellers to offer a wider range of affordable products.Stock still well above IPO priceDespite Monday’s decline,Meesho sharescontinue to trade well above their IP",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/bofa-takes-a-measured-view-on-meeshos-next-phase-starts-coverage-with-neutral-rating-stock-sheds-5/articleshow/126483300.cms,economictimes,2026-01-22,neutral

Vodafone Idea AGR relief offers breathing room but shareholders still await clarity,"Vodafone Idea(VIL) may have received a temporary lifeline with the Department of Telecommunications’ recent decision to defer its AGR (Adjusted Gross Revenue) dues for four years, but for shareholders, the outlook remains far from reassuring.With no immediate boost in earnings visibility and capital infusion still elusive, analysts say investors must temper their expectations.In its latest update, the DoT acknowledged VIL’s request to convert interest on AGR dues into equity and confirmed that the final amount for conversion will be determined once audited figures are submitted. Until then, the company has been granted a four-year moratorium on its AGR payments, a move that alleviates near-term cash flow pressure, but does not address the telecom player’s underlying structural issues.According to domestic brokerage firm Motilal Oswal Financial Services, while the deferment may help preserve cash, Vodafone Idea continues to face formidable hurdles: a Rs 2.2 trillion debt burden, high annual payouts to the government (~Rs 400 billion in spectrum and AGR obligations), and rising network costs.Motilal Oswal notes that ""AGR dues of Rs 4,390 crore are only deferred, not written off"", and these will have to be paid eventually.Live EventsAnother brokerage firm,JM Financial, echoes this, stating that the company now has breathing room to focus on operational improvements and network investments. However, the firm also reiterates that this relief does not eliminate the liability, and investors should temper expectations of a full revival based on this relief alone.Despite marginal growth in ARPU (average revenue per user) and flat EBITDA, the brokerage highlights that cash losses are persisting, and subscriber churn continues.Most critically, VIL’s 5G rollout remains on paper. The operator hasn’t made any visible headway on monetizing the 5G spectrum it holds, and the need for a sizeable capital raise, likely upwards of Rs 250 billion, remains unfulfilled.While promoters have",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/vodafone-idea-agr-relief-offers-breathing-room-but-shareholders-still-await-clarity/articleshow/126480295.cms,economictimes,2026-01-22,neutral

"Swiggy sees FII, mutual fund buying for third consecutive quarter. Time to buy the dip?","Swiggyis drawing steady interest from large institutional investors, including Foreign Institutional Investors (FIIs) and mutual funds (MFs). When such institutions consistently increase their stake in a company, it often reflects strong confidence, as these investors usually commit capital only after detailed research. Retail investors often watch these trends closely to identify potential opportunities.According to the latest shareholding data for the December 2025 quarter, both FIIs and MFs have raised their stakes in Swiggy. FIIs increased their holdings from 12.23% to 16.07%, marking the third consecutive quarter of growth. Meanwhile, mutual funds raised their stake from 11.89% to 17.23%, continuing a trend that has lasted five consecutive quarters. Notably, MFs have never reduced their stake in Swiggy since its listing in November 2024, signalling long-term confidence in the company.Despite this institutional interest, Swiggy’s stock has underperformed over the past year, declining around 30% and currently trading at Rs 344, below its IPO price of Rs 390. This highlights the contrast between short-term market performance and long-term institutional confidence.On Monday, as of 1.05 pm, Swiggy’s stock was down 2.20% at Rs 343.85, with a market capitalisation of approximately Rs 94,885 crore.Trendlyne forecaster data shows that 25 analysts give Swiggy a consensus ‘BUY’ rating, with a target price implying a 42% upside from current levels.Live EventsOn the technical front, the 14-day Relative Strength Index (RSI) stands at 28.7. In technical analysis, an RSI below 30 is generally considered oversold, which means the stock may have been sold off excessively in the short term.

"Reliance Industries shares rebound 2.2% from day's low, still down 5% in 2026. Should you buy before Q3 results on Friday?","Shares of Mukesh Ambani-ledReliance Industriesrebounded 2.2% from the day’s low to end 0.5% higher at Rs 1,483 on January 12, snapping their recent slide. Despite the recovery, the stock remains under pressure in 2026 so far, having declined over 5% year-to-date. The oil-to-telecom conglomerate is scheduled to announce its December-quarter (Q3FY26) results on January 16.Should you buy, sell or hold ahead of earnings?On January 9, Goldman Sachs raised its 12-month price target onReliance Industriesto Rs 1,835 a share, implying an upside of about 25% from current levels. The brokerage has reiterated its Buy rating, arguing that near-term moderation in retail will be offset by improving refining fundamentals and steady momentum in telecom, keeping Reliance’s medium-term earnings trajectory intact.The brokerage expects Q3 earnings growth in retail to moderate due to weak discretionary spending, base effects and festive timing. However, this is likely to be partly offset by a strong refining-led performance in the oil-to-chemicals (O2C) business. As a result, overall earnings remain largely unchanged despite tweaks at the segment level.Nomura estimated Reliance Industries’ consolidatedEBITDAat Rs 47,600 crore for 3QFY26F, reflecting a 4% quarter-on-quarter increase. While the refining segment is expected to deliver a strong performance, this could be partly offset by weaker petrochemical margins and a muted showing in the retail business. Meanwhile, Jio is likely to report steady operating performance during the quarter. Analysts have a Buy call and a target price of Rs 1,700 per share.Within the Oil-to-Chemicals (O2C) segment, EBITDA is estimated at Rs 16,500 crore, up 10% QoQ, led by widening refining margins. The improvement is expected to be driven by sequential gains in gasoline, diesel and jet fuel spreads, although softer petrochemical margins may partially temper the overall upside.Live EventsFor the Upstream business, Nomura forecasts EBITDA of Rs 4,900 crore, d",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/ril-shares-tumble-8-in-2026-should-you-buy-before-q3-results-on-friday/articleshow/126478400.cms,economictimes,2026-01-22,neutral

IEX shares extend slide to 35% from peak amid market coupling overhang: Buy or avoid?,"Indian Energy Exchange(IEX) shares fell 9% over the past two sessions, reversing a brief rally in which the stock jumped 14% after the electricity regulator’s counsel sought time from theAppellate Tribunal for Electricity(APTEL) to obtain instructions from theCentral Electricity Regulatory Commission(CERC) on withdrawing themarket couplingorder.The shares fell over 7% on Friday after APTEL deferred the hearing on market coupling norms to January 19. The IEX stock has plunged 35% from its peak and is currently trading below its 50-day and 200-day simple moving averages (SMAs) of Rs 140.8 and Rs 162.5, respectively, according to Trendlyne data.What should investors do?Market expert Nilesh Jain recommended strictly avoiding any fresh positions in the stock. He calls the technical chart structure of IEX weak, with support lying at Rs 132 and resistance at Rs 150.Technical expert Anuj Gupta echoes a similar sentiment, recommending investors to avoid the stock for now citing continued weakness in the power stock.

"IEX shares rebound 3%, snap 2-day fall. Should investors buy, sell or hold?","Shares ofIndian Energy Exchange(IEX) rose as much as 3% to an intraday high of Rs 142 on January 12, snapping a two-session losing streak in which the stock had fallen about 10%. The rebound appears to reflect value buying emerging at lower levels, with the stock seen as oversold after the recent correction.The company has been in the news off late after it challenged the Central Electricity Regulatory Commission’s (CERC) July 2025 order onmarket couplingbefore the Appellate Tribunal for Electricity (APTEL). Market coupling is a structural reform that could potentially alter how electricity prices are discovered across power exchanges. The market sees this move as diluting the company’s dominance in price discovery, liquidity, and trading volumes.What should investors do?At the hearing held last week, discussions were centred on the process adopted by the regulator rather than on the concept of market coupling itself. While market coupling is still likely to be implemented over time, its timeline remains uncertain given the complexity of execution, the high likelihood of a fresh formulation process and the potential for further litigation.In this context,JM Financialmaintained its Add rating on the stock, valuing it at 30x FY28 EPS to arrive at a base-case target price of Rs 158. That translates to an upside potential of 14.5% from current market levels. Separately, CERC submitted an affidavit stating that it is not withdrawing its order on market coupling, suggesting that the regulatory process remains active but far from conclusive, the brokerage added.Live EventsOn the other hand, Bernstein reiterated an 'Underperform' rating on IEX and set a target price of Rs 115, saying regulatory risks, rather than operating performance, will be the decisive factor for the stock.

"After blockbuster 2025, metal stocks tumble up to 10% weekly this year. What’s ahead?","After a stellar 2025,metal stockshave entered 2026 on a slightly weaker note, with some names sliding up to 10% in a week. While investors have booked profits amid renewed concerns overUS tariff threats, market experts believe the sector’s strong fundamentals and favourable momentum could still support further upside, advocating a selective stock-picking approach.Even as investors' wealth wiped out by nearly Rs 9 lakh crore in the first seven sessions in the new year, commodities were at the fore-front of the sell-off with metal as the second worst-hit sector after the Oil & Gas.Nifty Metal index's 3% weekly decline was largely triggered by a correction in the last two trading sessions. Individually, Jindal Stainless was the worst performer, slipping 10% over a week. It was followed by Welspun Corp and Jindal Steel which fell 7%, each. Others like Lloyds Metals & Energy, Adani Enterprises, NMDC, Hindustan Copper, Hindustan Zinc, Hindalco Industries, Tata Steel, APL Apollo Tubes, JSW Steel, Steel Authority of India (SAIL) and Vedanta were down between 6% and 1%.

What’s driving the selloff?","Indian equities extended their slump on Monday, with the Sensex and Nifty deepening a selloff that has erased nearly Rs 18.55 lakh crore in market value in six days and left investors grappling with fresh uncertainty at home and abroad.The BSE Sensex slumped over 700 points, to the day's low of 82,864, while the NSE Nifty 50 slid over 150 points, slipping below the 25,500 mark.From a closing high of 85,762.01 on Jan 2, the Sensex has shed more than 2,903 points, touching an intraday low of 82,864 on Monday. The Nifty has declined about 3.2% over the same period, hitting a low of 25,473.The declines come on the heels of the market’s worst weekly performance in more than three months, reflecting investor unease after an anticipated U.S. Supreme Court ruling on President Donald Trump’s tariffs failed to materialise, prolonging a policy overhang.The market capitalisation of all listed BSE companies has fallen by Rs 18.55 lakh crore in six days to Rs 462.68 lakh crore in six days.Live EventsWhy stock market is falling today?

The drama surrounding the US-India trade deal is getting murkier with strange remarks from the US administration. This is impacting the market,” said Dr. VK Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist at Geojit Investments.He added that global flashpoints are compounding the unease. “Geopolitical developments in Venezuela, the crisis in Iran and Trump’s threats regarding Greenland are also being viewed by the markets with concern.

BHEL shares tumble 6% as Chinese import fears resurface. Should investors buy this dip?,"Shares ofBharat Heavy Electricals Ltd(BHEL) slipped as much as 6% to an intraday low of Rs 258.30 on January 12, as investors reassessed reports that India may ease restrictions on Chinese firms bidding for government contracts. The development has raised concerns about intensifying competition and potential pressure on pricing and margins for state-run power equipment makers.With the latest decline, the stock is down 15% in three sessions, resuming its downward trend after closing higher in the previous session.What should investors do?BHEL sharesended the previous week about 9% lower, though the stock attempted a partial recovery on Friday after Thursday’s sharp decline. According to Anand James of Geojit Investments, the fall appears to be a single-day event, followed by the formation of an inside bar pattern, which supports the possibility of an upside move in the week ahead. However, he cautioned that the stock breached its 50-day simple moving average for the first time since mid-September and closed below it last week. As a result, he advised waiting for a pullback above Rs 280 as confirmation before turning decisively bullish.What’s ailing the stock?Live EventsThe selloff comes after media reports suggesting that India plans to scrap curbs on Chinese firms bidding for government contracts. These restrictions were introduced in 2020 under the Atmanirbhar Bharat package and subsequent amendments to the General Financial Rules, following India-China border tensions.As part of those measures, bidders from countries sharing a land border with India were required to obtain mandatory political and security clearances, effectively restricting imports from China across sensitive sectors, including power and energy.What are experts saying?International brokerage firm Jefferies struck a cautious tone last week, calling the possible easing of restrictions a “potential negative development” for some industrial players.It said that companies such as BHEL, Afcons, L&T, are",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/bhel-shares-tumble-15-in-just-two-sessions-should-investors-buy-this-dip/articleshow/126475178.cms,economictimes,2026-01-22,neutral
Sensex suffers the worst start to a year in a decade. What this selloff means for investors?,"India's equity markets have had a rough start to 2026. Data from Ace Equity showed that the benchmarkBSE Sensexfell 1.93% between January 1 and January 10, marking its worst opening stretch to a calendar year in the last 10 years. The last time markets saw a sharper fall in the same period was in 2016, when theSensexhad declined 4.53% amid global growth fears and China-led volatility.The weak start has raised many questions for investors on whether they should be worried, or is this just a temporary setback?What happened in the first 10 days of 2026The sell-off gathered pace in the first full trading week of the year. The Sensex fell 2.55% for the week ended January 9 to close at 83,576, while theNifty50 dropped 2.45% to 25,683. Broader markets fared even worse, with midcap and smallcap indices falling 2.6% and just over 3%, signalling a clear shift to risk aversion.According to Dr Ravi Singh, Chief Research Officer at Master Capital Services, the pressure came from a mix of global shocks and domestic caution. He said markets were hit by rising geopolitical uncertainty after the US approved a Russian sanctions bill that could lead to steep tariffs, including on countries buying Russian energy. This was compounded by the lack of progress on the US–India trade deal, which markets had expected to move forward early in the year.Expectations of mixed Q3 earnings and sustained foreign institutional investor selling added to the negative mood.

Hyundai Motor India shares plunge 20% from all-time peak. Will Q3 help turn the tide?,"Despite the GST 2.0 lift-off,Hyundai Motor India’s stock has fallen 20% from the record high it touched in September 2025, as investors reassess the company’s growth outlook amid mixed signals on demand and margin concerns emanating from its newest plant. While analysts continue to forecast steady revenue growth supported by exports, a richer product mix and currency tailwinds, concerns over the limited benefit from the GST rate cut and near-term headwinds have kept investors on edge. Here’s what experts are saying.Has GST 2.0 delivered for Hyundai?InCred Equities does not believe so. The brokerage said the benefit from the lower 18% GST rate is limited to just 30% of Hyundai’s net sales. Strong growth over the last three years in exports, parts and services, and large SUVs has reduced Hyundai’s dependence on products covered under the new GST rate to 30% of net sales value in FY25.With demand sensitivity expected to be higher in low-priced compact cars, InCred believes Hyundai’s sales benefit from the GST rate cut will be limited compared with peers such asMaruti SuzukiandTata Motors. This, it said, could extend the underperformance of Hyundai’s domestic volume growth versus the market leader seen in recent months.On the capacity front, InCred said nearly 30% capacity expansion is likely from the recently commissioned Pune plant. The brokerage expects the facility to initially produce refreshed versions of the Venue and Exter, while a new compact car launch is scheduled for FY27F. An India-dedicated electric vehicle planned for CY27F will also be closely tracked.Live EventsMargins could face pressure in the near term. InCred said the high overheads of the new plant may weigh on EBITDA margins until capacity utilisation improves, even as Hyundai’s margin resilience over the past six months has surprised the brokerage.While InCred raised FY26F–28F EPS estimates for Hyundai by 2 to 7% on favourable INR depreciation, it maintained a cautious stance on valuation.

Banks to review Vodafone Idea funding plan after AGR relief,"Mumbai: Banks led byState Bank of Indiawill reassess extending fresh funds toVodafone Ideaafter the government last week approved a relief package freezing the telco’s adjusted gross revenue (AGR) dues and stretching repayment over 16 years.Bankers said the decision has altered the company's liability profile, adding that clarity on its funding needs and future business plans are crucial for considering fresh funding.Banks have been wary of lending to Vi because of its huge liabilities, majorly consisting of statutory dues including deferred spectrum payment and AGR liabilities, strained cash flows, and doubts about its ability to service new loans. “Our team will reassess (extending fresh funds) in the light of the new developments,” a senior bank executive familiar with the details said.“Vi required Rs 35,000 crore, according to the plans shared by the company previously. We need to figure out how much they need now and how much is viable based on the firm's cash flows,” the banker told ET on condition of anonymity. “It’s a big amount and will have to come from a consortium of lenders for which banks will have to meet and decide.”Staggered RepaymentsLive EventsLead lenderSBIdid not reply to an email seeking comment. Last week, the Department of Telecommunications (DoT) froze Vi’s AGR dues of Rs 87,695 crore for the period from 2006-07 to 2018-19, and allowed staggered repayments over 16 years until 2041. Under the revised schedule, Vi will pay Rs 124 crore annually for six years between March 2026 and 2031, followed by Rs 100 crore per year for four years from March 2032-35.The remaining amount will be repaid in equal annual instalments over six years from March 2036-41, after a DoT-appointed committee reassesses the final liability, the filing said. This means nearly 95% of Vi’s AGR liability of Rs 87,695 crore will remain frozen for the next decade. “This is a significant development as it deals with a big overhang,” a second bank executive said. “Vi needs funds",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/banks-to-review-vodafone-idea-funding-plan-after-agr-relief/articleshow/126473430.cms,economictimes,2026-01-22,neutral
Looking sharp!

Outlook over the medium term is positive,"" Venkatesalu told ET.

He notes that markets typically respond well to such structural moves, albeit with a lag.Live Events“Valuations have seen both price and time correction, making the setup for 2026 relatively constructive,” he said.

Dalal Street Week Ahead: Nifty tests key support levels as volatility rises,"The markets saw a decisive breakdown from the 500-point trading range (26,200- 25,700) after a period of consolidation, ending the week on a negative note. Throughout the week,Niftytraded with a clear downward bias, oscillating within a range of 750 points between 26,373 and 25,623. It was the only major global equity index to end in the red, weighed down by rising uncertainty around US trade tariffs and a deferred Supreme Court decision, now expected on January 14.India VIX spiked 16.51% for the week to 10.93, reflecting heightened caution. As a result, Nifty ended the week with a loss of 645.25 points or -2.45%.The current technical structure signals a potential pause in the prevailing uptrend as the index has closed below the lower edge of the 500-point trading range. The close below the 20-week moving average (25,579) would end up in some incremental weakness. Markets remain vulnerable to further pressure, especially amid a combination of domestic consolidation and global risk events. A breach below the current support region could deepen the corrective move, while a bounce back above 25,850–25,900 would be essential to regain strength.ETMarkets.comThe coming week may open on a tentative note, likely influenced by further developments from the US. Initial resistance is expected at 25,900 and then 26,100, while immediate support lies at 25,500, followed by a more crucial zone near 25,300. A failure to defend 25,300 could attract incremental weakness.Live EventsThe weekly RSI stands at 53.16 and has marked a fresh 14-period low; it remains neutral without any divergence against price. However, its flattening near the midline suggests waning momentum.

"Moody’s affirms Shriram Finance’s Ba1 rating, outlook revised to positive after MUFG Bank investment","Moody’s Ratings has affirmed the Ba1 long-term corporate family rating (CFR) ofShriram FinanceLimited (SFL) and revised its outlook to positive from stable. The rating action follows SFL’s announcement of a planned strategic investment by MUFG Bank.According to Moody’s, the outlook revision reflects expectations that SFL’s business and financial profile will strengthen over the coming quarters. This is based on MUFG Bank's plans to acquire a 20% stake in SFL through a preferential allotment of shares worth Rs 396 billion (approximately $4.4 billion).The transaction is subject to regulatory approvals and is expected to close in 2026.Moody’s noted that the investment will provide SFL with strategic benefits, including a stronger capital base, improved access to global funding channels, and enhanced risk management practices. The rating agency expects that SFL’s capitalisation will materially improve after the transaction, while profitability is expected to strengthen gradually as the company’s cost of funds declines.Additionally, both onshore and offshore funding access are likely to improve.Live EventsOn a pro forma basis, the capital infusion is projected to increase the company’s tangible common equity to tangible managed assets (TCE/TMA) ratio to over 29%, compared to 19% as of March 2025.This would place SFL among the highest capitalisednon-bank finance companiesin India. Moody’s expects the company to maintain a TCE/TMA ratio above 20% over the next four to five years, taking into account its credit growth.SFL’s profitability is also expected to strengthen over the next 12 to 18 months, supported by lower funding costs and improved access to liquidity following the transaction.

Stock Market Holiday? NSE to remain open on January 15 during Maharashtra civic polls,"Indian stock exchange NSE will remain open for regular trading on January 15 even though Maharashtra has declared a public holiday for civic polls across several big cities in the state.NSE in a circular said January 15 will be a settlement holiday on this date. This means, there will be no settlement for T+0 settlement on January 15. While trading activity may continue as per the exchange timetable, clearing and settlement obligations for that specific T+0 cycle will not be processed on that day.Because of the settlement holiday, the settlement schedule for T+1 trades has also been adjusted. As per the revised schedule, trades done on January 14 will now be settled on January 16. For trades executed on January 15, settlement will also take place on January 16.Settlement holidays are typically declared during elections or major public events when banking and clearing operations are affected. Because January 15 is a public holiday in the state, most of the banks would remain closed on the date.For retail investors, the key takeaway is that trading is not impacted, but the credit of shares or funds may be delayed by a day around January 15 due to the settlement holiday.Live EventsStock market holidays in 2026Indian stock exchanges will remain shut for 15 days in 2026. The holiday calendar begins with Republic Day on January 26 and covers a mix of major national and religious occasions. Key closures in the first half of the year include Holi on March 3, Ram Navami on March 26, Mahavir Jayanti on March 31 and Good Friday on April 3.

"Sebi eases technical glitch norms for stock brokers, cuts compliance burden for smaller firms","Capital markets regulator Sebi announced an overhaul of its framework for handling technical glitches in stock brokers'electronic trading systems, a move aimed at improving ease of compliance and reducing regulatory burden, particularly for smaller brokers.In a press release, the market regulator said it had reviewed the existing technical glitch framework following public consultation and feedback from market participants. The revised norms are part of Sebi's broader push to create a more conducive regulatory environment and support ease of doing business for intermediaries in the securities market.One of the key changes is the streamlining of eligibility criteria for the applicability of the technical glitch framework. Under the revised rules, the framework will now apply only to stock brokers with more than 10,000 registered clients.Sebi said this change would exclude smaller brokers with limited business scale and lower dependence on technology, resulting in nearly 60% of stock brokers moving out of the framework and seeing a meaningful reduction in compliance requirements.Sebi has also carved out specific exemptions from the applicability of the technical glitch norms. Glitches that occur outside a broker’s trading architecture, those that do not directly impact trading functionality, and incidents with negligible impact have been exempted from the framework.Live EventsAccording to the regulator, this provides brokers immunity from events beyond their control and from issues that do not affect their ability to offer seamless trading services.Another major change relates to reporting requirements. Sebi has extended the timeline for reporting technical glitches from one hour to two hours, offering brokers greater operational flexibility.The revised framework also takes trading holidays into account while submitting reports and replaces the requirement of reporting to multiple exchanges with a single reporting mechanism through a Common Reporting Platform.

Bad start to 2026 as Rs 9 lakh crore lost in 5 days. What should stock market investors do?,"Indian equity markets had the worst possible start to the new year as selling pressure intensified through the week, wiping out confidence of any stability that market participants had entering into the year. The Sensex fell another 600 points on Friday, taking the total decline to over 2,000 points across all five trading sessions of the week. In value terms, investors lost more than Rs 9 lakh crore, marking one of the most unsettling starts to a calendar year in recent memory.The sharp correction came at a time when investors were hoping for stability after months of volatility. Instead, global uncertainty, rising geopolitical risks and renewed trade tensions combined to deliver what market participants described as a ""risk-off"" phase across Dalal Street.Trump tariffs weigh heavily on sentimentThe dominant trigger behind the sustained selloff was renewed tariff-related rhetoric from US President Donald Trump. Markets have remained under pressure since Trump signalled that tariffs on Indian goods could be raised over India’s continued purchases of Russian crude oil.The situation worsened after the US also hinted at imposing punitive 500% tariffs on countries importing Russian oil, rekindling fears of a major disruption to global trade flows.The India-US trade relationship has come sharply into focus as negotiations on a bilateral trade agreement remain unresolved despite six rounds of talks since March. Adding to the uncertainty, US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick recently claimed that the deal stalled due to a lack of direct engagement between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Trump.

Reliance Industries loses $15 billion market cap in bruising start to 2026,"Reliance Industries Ltd. is off to bruising start to the year, with shares down more than 6% as investors digest weak retail outlooks and tougher US rhetoric on India’sRussian oilpurchases — putting the onus on upcoming earnings to arrest the slide.The selloff so far this year has wiped about $15 billion off the company’s market value, making it one of the stock’s worst starts to a year in recent memory and weighing on India’s benchmark equity gauges. Reliance will report quarterly earnings after close of trading on Jan. 16.ETMarkets.comPressure on the stock intensified this week after several of India’s largest retailers flagged weaker-than-expected consumer demand, stoking concern that Reliance — a major player in the segment — could face a similar slowdown. Sentiment worsened afterUS Senator Lindsey Grahamproposed legislation targeting countries that buy Russian oil, pushing the shares’ weekly decline past 7%, the steepest in more than 15 months.The weakness follows an almost 30% rally in Reliance shares last year, fueled by expectations that the oil-to-telecom conglomerate was preparing to list Jio Platforms Ltd. in what could be India’s biggest initial public offering. Growing concern over tougher US action on Russia has since cooled investor appetite for the company, which in recent quarters has benefited from refining discounted Russian crude.Goldman Sachs Group Inc. analysts expect the company’s retail business to report slower growth for the quarter through December on lower discretionary spending but the same would be offset by a strong growth in energy business.Live EventsThe recent selloff in shares was “potentially due to concerns around refining exposure to Russian crude and softer retail growth momentum across peers,” analysts including Nikhil Bhandari wrote in a note dated Jan. 9.

The brokerage has a target price of Rs 370, implying an upside of 31% from current market levels.According to Bernstein, Blinkit has the ability to retain its leadership position and believes that the current price offers a more favorable risk-reward proposition given its established positive contribution margin, better operating metrics across the board and a much lower cash burn. The brokerage believes most of the competitive pressure and resulting impact is already priced in the stock.For Swiggy, over the longer term, Bernstein remains positive on its ability to deploy expanded cash cushion to scale its dark store network, improve operating metrics and strengthen unit economics.

Goldman Sachs raises Reliance Industries’ share price target ahead of Q3 results next week. Here’s why,"Goldman Sachshas raised its 12-month price target onReliance Industriesto Rs 1,835 a share, implying an upside of about 25% from current levels, exactly a week ahead of the company’s December quarter (Q3FY26) earnings. The brokerage has reiterated its Buy rating, arguing that near-term moderation in retail will be offset by improving refining fundamentals and steady momentum in telecom, keeping Reliance’s medium-term earnings trajectory intact.In a note dated January 9, Goldman Sachs said it has refreshed its estimates forRelianceby marking assumptions to evolving trends across segments. Like-for-like with peers, the brokerage expects Q3 earnings growth in retail to moderate due to weak discretionary spending, base effects and festive timing. However, this is likely to be partly offset by a strong refining-led performance in the oil-to-chemicals (O2C) business. As a result, overall earnings remain largely unchanged despite tweaks at the segment level.Reliance Industries' stock price has corrected about 8% in the last couple of trading sessions after outperforming the Sensex, Nifty and peers over the past year. The international brokerage attributes the recent pullback to investor concerns around Reliance’s exposure to Russian crude and softer retail growth momentum. But analysts believe these worries are overdone and see limited impact on the company’s medium-term earnings profile. Here’s what the brokerage is saying about Q3.Refining remains the key pillarGoldman Sachs analysts expect O2C EBITDA in Q3FY26 to rise 11% quarter-on-quarter and 16% year-on-year, driven by stronger refining earnings that more than offset a sequential decline in petrochemicals.

BHEL is down about 5% over the past week and has fallen 2.6% so far in 2026.Why the China factor spooked the marketThe selloff was triggered by media reports suggesting that India plans to scrap curbs on Chinese firms bidding for government contracts. These restrictions were introduced in 2020 under the Atmanirbhar Bharat package and subsequent amendments to the General Financial Rules, followingIndia-China border tensions.As part of those measures, bidders from countries sharing a land border with India were required to obtain mandatory political and security clearances, effectively restricting imports from China across sensitive sectors, including power and energy.Live EventsJM Financial: Relief, not risk, for PSUsJM Financial said the removal of restrictions, especially at the component level, could actually benefit public sector undertakings such as BHEL rather than hurt them.“Removal of restrictions at the components level (e.g., CRGO steel) will benefit PSUs like BHEL,” the brokerage said, adding that even a broader easing would have “little impact” given developers’ past experience with Chinese equipment and strong domestic demand within China itself.JM Financial noted that before the restrictions, Indian heavy electrical equipment manufacturers imported large quantities of castings, forgings and pipes from China.

"ITC, Eternal among 15 stocks in CLSA’s 2026 focus portfolio. Check full list & targets here","Indian equities head into 2026 with a challenging but more balanced setup after the Nifty’s record underperformance in 2025 narrowed India’s valuation premium versus peers, according to CLSA. While absolute index upside may be capped given elevated valuations, CLSA expects improving earnings visibility and compressed stock-level valuations to create bottom-up opportunities.

For Tata Motors PV, the brokerage has a target price of Rs 450, backed by a better domestic passenger vehicle outlook, GST cuts and new launches. CLSA has not assigned a target price for Tata Motors CV, but expects a cyclical upturn driven by rising freight demand, improving utilisation and replacement-led growth.

RIL shares in spotlight as firm evaluates Venezuelan crude purchases,"Shares ofReliance Industries(RIL) are expected to be in the spotlight on Friday, January 9, after the company indicated it would consider purchasingVenezuelan crude oilif allowed underUS regulations.Reliance, which operates the world’s largest refining complex, said it is awaiting clarity on whether Venezuelan oil will be accessible to non-US buyers and confirmed it would pursue purchases in a compliant manner once regulatory permission is clear.The statement follows a significant shift in US–Venezuelan energy dynamics, with Caracas and Washington reaching an agreement this week to export up to $2 billion worth of Venezuelan crude — an estimated 30-50 million barrels — to the United States.If restrictions are eased for non-US entities, Indian refiners could potentially resume or expand imports of Venezuelan crude, which had largely fallen off India’s crude import list due to previous sanctions and tariff barriers.Reliance had halted Venezuelan oil purchases in March 2025 after the US imposed a 25% tariff oncrude importsfrom Venezuela, with its last shipment received in May 2025.Live EventsThe company operates two large refinery complexes in Gujarat with a combined capacity of about 1.4 million barrels per day, facilities well-suited to process heavier crude grades such as Venezuela’s Merey blend.Other Indian refiners, includingIndian Oil Corporation(IOC) andHindustan PetroleumCorp (HPCL), are also expected to evaluate Venezuelan crude imports if non-US entities are permitted to participate in such transactions.Analysts say that the return of Venezuelan barrels to global markets could come at discounted prices, enhancing feedstock optionality and potentially improvingrefining marginsfor compatible refiners.Additionally, Venezuelan crude may present a politically safer alternative to Russian oil, especially amid rising scrutiny of Russian energy trade linked to the war in Ukraine.

IEX shares fall 6% as APTEL begins hearing on market coupling case,"Shares ofIndian Energy Exchange(IEX) declined 5.8% to Rs 141.40 on the BSE on Wednesday as the Appellate Tribunal for Electricity (APTEL) began hearing the case against theCentral Electricity Regulatory Commission’s (CERC) market coupling directions.During the proceedings, the APTEL bench stated that it wants to ensure CERC has functioned in a fair manner and has acted independently in its decision-making.The bench also noted that it would be incorrect to assume that the 2025 ruling, norms, or orders will automatically continue, indicating that the previous directive may not be upheld.The ongoing hearing marks a critical development in the long-standing regulatory debate surrounding market coupling, with implications for IEX’s role in price discovery and overall market structure.Ahead of the hearing, the Central Electricity Regulatory Commission (CERC) had issued a fresh clarification on its July 2025 market coupling order.Live EventsIn its latest statement, CERC said the order should be read as “directions,” a move that appears to have heightened investor caution ahead of the scheduled hearing by the Appellate Tribunal for Electricity (APTEL).The clarification came just before the round of proceedings in the market coupling case, where APTEL was set to hear petitions challenging the formulation process of the July order.The hearing was earlier postponed after the CERC told the tribunal it was willing to take directions regarding the withdrawal of its contentious July 23, 2025, order that had sparked strong reactions in the market.The original order had introduced a market coupling mechanism, a structural reform that could potentially alter how electricity prices are discovered across power exchanges.

"Premium gain, margin strain likely for insurers in December quarter","Mumbai: Theinsurance sectoris likely to report a steady performance for the third quarter of this financial year, aided by strongpremium growthacross life, general and health insurers after goods and services tax (GST) relaxations, even as margins remain under pressure, according to analysts.Most large life insurers, including state-ownedLife InsuranceCorporation (LIC) and private insurers such asHDFC Life, Axis Max andSBI Life, are expected to report double-digit growth in annualised premium equivalent (APE) for October-December 2025, aided by GST-related tailwinds and an easier base following the implementation of revised surrender value norms.Lower effective prices, particularly for term protection products, have supported demand, helping private insurers sustain momentum. LIC is expected to benefit from a low base and see growth of more than 40% in APE, especially due to an increase in group business.Profitability, however, remains a challenge. Value of new business (VNB) margins are expected to stay under pressure due to the loss of GST input tax credits, alongside higher employee-related costs following labour code implementation. Insurers are attempting to cushion the impact through a gradual shift toward higher-margin non-participating and protection products, as well as tighter distributor negotiations. These measures are expected to partially offset margin compression during the quarter.General insurers are likely to post double-digit growth in gross written premiums, mainly driven by continued strength in motor and health insurance.

Zerodha’s Nithin Kamath explains why tracking lock-in expiries is a must for IPO investors,"ZerodhaCEO and founderNithin Kamathhas cautionedretail investorsto pay close attention to lock-in periods when investing in initial public offerings (IPOs), noting that large shareholder sell-offs after lock-in expiries can put pressure on stock prices.In a post on the micro-blogging platform X, formerly Twitter, Kamath explained that when a company goes public, not all shareholders are permitted to sell their shares immediately. Certain categories of shareholders such as promoters, early investors and employee stock option (ESOP) holders are typically subject to lock-in restrictions that can range from 30 days to as long as 18 months.These shareholders often hold sizeable stakes, Kamath noted, and their eventual exit can have a material impact on a stock’s performance. “Since these are large shareholders, whenever they sell, there can often be a downward move in the stock price,” he said, flagging a risk that retail investors may overlook while chasing newly listed stocks. Against this backdrop, he advised investors to track lock-in expiries as part of their investment decision-making process, especially when buying shares of recently listed companies.To be sure, data from Nuvama shows that between January 6 and April 30, 2026, pre-listing shareholder lock-in periods are set to expire for 96 companies, covering shares valued at about $45 billion. While this represents the total value of shares becoming eligible for trading, it does not imply that all of them will come up for sale, as a significant portion is held by promoters and promoter group entities.Separately, Kamath, who frequently shares insights on the platform, also highlighted structural limits on the broking business. In a post dated January 6, he said the 15% open interest (OI) cap at the broker level places a hard ceiling on how much a broking firm can grow and the pace of that growth. While the restriction limits scale, he added, it ultimately benefits consumers by reducing concentration risk and prev",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/zerodhas-nithin-kamath-explains-why-tracking-lock-in-expiries-is-a-must-for-ipo-investors/articleshow/126411606.cms,economictimes,2026-01-22,neutral

"Export-heavy stocks bleed on Trump's 500% tariff signal; Gokaldas, Avanti crack up to 12%","Export-oriented stocks came under sharp selling pressure on Thursday after fresh political signals from the US raised fears of extremely high import duties, unnerving investors already wary of global trade risks. Shares of seafood exporters, textile makers, pharmaceutical companies, and metal producers fell across the board as markets reacted to the possibility of tariffs rising up to 500% under a proposed US sanctions framework.The trigger for the sell-off was a statement by US Senator Lindsey Graham, who said that US President Donald Trump had given the green light to a bipartisan Russia sanctions bill.The proposed legislation seeks to sharply raise duties on Russian imports into the United States to at least 500% of their value and could be used as leverage against countries such as India, China, and Brazil that continue to buy Russian oil.The senator indicated that the bill could be brought to a bipartisan vote as early as next week and expressed confidence in strong cross-party backing. He described the proposed law as a critical diplomatic tool linked to negotiations surrounding the Russia-Ukraine conflict.Meanwhile, Trump has warned of higher tariffs on Indian goods if New Delhi does not address US concerns related to Russian crude imports.

"Budget may tap oil windfall? JM Financial flags excise-duty risk for HPCL, BPCL, IOCL; backs Oil India, ONGC","With theUnion Budget 2026-27just weeks away and Brent crude hovering near $60 a barrel,JM Financialis urging investors to pick their oil and gas bets carefully. The brokerage has reiterated buy ratings onOil IndiaandONGC, while warning of fiscal risks for state-runoil marketing companies, maintaining a sell onHPCLand reduce calls onIOCLandBPCL, citing potential excise-duty hikes that could offset gains from low crude prices.JM Financial said subdued crude prices could continue to support near-term marketing margins for OMCs but cautioned that the government could use the upcomingBudgetto claw back revenue gains through higher excise duties on petrol and diesel. “OMCs’ blended auto-fuel GMM of ~INR 8.2/ltr (vs. historical GMM of INR 3.5/ltr) implies INR 3-4/ltr scope for a hike in excise duty,” the brokerage noted. “Every INR 1/ltr increase in excise duty can boost central government revenue by INR 165 bn annually.”Upstream stocks stand outFor upstream producers, JM Financial sees significant value at current prices, which already factor in weaker near-term crude realizations. The brokerage reiterated its buy rating on Oil India, with a revised target of Rs 500 per share, and on ONGC, with a revised target of Rs 290 per share, citing medium-term production growth and attractive current valuations.“We prefer Oil India as it could be a ~15% earnings-compounding story over the next 2-3 years,” JM Financial said, citing expected 20-25% cumulative oil and gas production growth and the expansion of the Numaligarh refinery from 3mmtpa to 9mmtpa.

"Jio IPO may re-rate Bharti Airtel, says Jefferies; raises target price","Jio’s planned mega IPO in the first half of 2026 could turn into an important re‑rating catalyst for Bharti Airtel, withJefferiesarguing that tariff hikes and higher sector weight in indices will work in Bharti’s favour rather than against it. The brokerage has raised its target price onBharti Airtelto Rs 2,760, implying about 32% upside from current levels and reiterating the stock as its top pick in the Indian telecom industry.Billionaire Mukesh Ambani had last year guided to listing Jio Platforms Ltd (JPL) in the first half of the calendar year 2026. Analysts say that it could largely be an offer for sale by financial investors, while strategic shareholders such asReliance, Meta, and Google are expected to stay invested.Jefferies argues that once Jio is listed, public market scrutiny will sharpen the operator’s focus on monetisation and returns, making fresh mobile tariff hikes in 2026 more, not less, likely.According to Jefferies’ sensitivity work, a 10–20% tariff increase is needed in FY27 for Jio’s equity valuation to move closer to Bharti’s and to deliver a double‑digit internal rate of return to existing private‑equity investors. Without such hikes, Jio’s FY27 EBITDA could be about 14% lower at around US$8.5 billion, capping investor IRRs at roughly 6–8%, versus a potential 8–14% IRR if tariffs are raised and the stock commands 12–15 times EV/EBITDA.Why Bharti may re‑rate alongside JioJefferies argues that Jio’s IPO is unlikely to act as an overhang for Bharti, citing the stock’s 32% gain in 2025 despite more than $5 billion of promoter share sales.Live EventsInstead, with Bharti’s India (ex‑towers) business already trading around 13 times EV/EBITDA, the brokerage expects Jio to be priced off Bharti’s multiples, leaving limited room for Bharti to de‑rate and opening scope for a further re‑rating as the listing approaches.Jefferies estimates that once Jio is included in major benchmarks with a roughly 33% free float, the neutral weight of telecom in headline ",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/jio-ipo-may-re-rate-bharti-airtel-says-jefferies-raises-target-price/articleshow/126407713.cms,economictimes,2026-01-22,neutral

The stock has shed nearly 4% over this period, ahead of the bank’s third-quarter earnings announcement scheduled for January 17.What’s in store for investors? December quarter performance points to steady balance-sheet expansion, with brokerages flagging a mixed near-term outlook on margins amid moderating yields, even as asset quality and cost discipline remain supportive.Management has indicated that most of the asset-side repricing is now behind, and NIMs are expected to benefit from the downward repricing of term deposits, with rate cuts already reflected in savings account rates.Axis Securities says HDFC Bank has remained largely on track with its guidance as it works towards reverting to pre-merger levels across key metrics, underpinned by strong execution capabilities. The brokerage has assigned a target price of Rs 1,170 per share, an upside of 23% from current levels. With the loan-to-deposit ratio (LDR) now below 100%, the bank is likely to accelerate growth in FY26 to align with system-wide trends. A further pickup in growth in FY27E, alongside sustained deposit mobilisation, should help bring the LDR down to sub-90%. Margin pressure seen in H1 is expected to ease in H2, supported by deposit repricing and the impact of CRR cuts on exit margins.InCred Equities, with a price target of Rs 1,180 per share, says margins are expected to trough at levels better than earlier anticipated, and, together with benign asset quality trends and sustained deposit growth momentum, this should support a rerating of the stock in the coming months.Live EventsThe Street is likely to closely track the extent of PSL compliance through organic growth as well as the bank’s borrowing repayment schedule.

"Adani Power, Tata Motors among 8 stocks with up to 72% upside as brokerages initiate coverage","A host of domestic and global brokerages have initiated coverage on select Indian stocks across sectors such as broking, financials, IT, and auto. Analysts are bullish on major names such as Adani Power, Groww, Coforge, Tata Motors, and forecast an upside of up to 72% from current market levels. Here is a list of 8 stocks on which brokerages initiated coverage this week. Domestic brokerage firm JM Financial initiated coverage on the stock with a ‘Buy’ rating, setting a target price of Rs 178 per share. This implies a potential upside of 20.2% from the current market price of approximately Rs 148.

"Ahead of Q3, HDFC Securities recommends a buy on Infosys, HCL, 5 more IT stocks for up to 52% upside","The Indian IT services sector is heading into a seasonally weak Q3FY26, with tier-I players likely to post 0.6–2.1% QoQ constant-currency growth and mid-tier firms ranging from -1.8% to +3.4%, according to HDFC Securities. Furloughs and macro uncertainty are expected to weigh on near-term revenues. Despite these headwinds, the brokerage has identified seven buy-rated stocks, with upside potential of up to 52%.

It was built on a combination of commodity-cycle support, stronger domestic coal offtake, and a market re-rating that rewarded cash-rich PSUs.First, the broader coal cycle turned favourable.India's power demandremained resilient through most of this period, and the policy priority shifted toward ensuring domestic coal availability and reducing imports.Coal India, which supplies the bulk of the country's coal needs, naturally benefited as coal production rose and the supply chain stabilised. Government data shows all-India coal production rose sharply in FY25 versus FY23, highlighting the multi-year push to raise domestic output.Coal India's earnings and cash flows also improved materially during the upcycle, helped by better realisations and a tighter domestic supply-demand balance.

The deal entails a 20% stake dilution through a preferential share allotment and ranks among the largest cross-border investments in India’s financial services sector.Three proxy advisory firms have recommended shareholders vote in favour of all three resolutions linked to the proposal. The first two special resolutions relate to the preferential allotment of a 20% equity stake to MUFG Bank and the grant of special rights to the investor. These resolutions require approval from at least 75% of votes cast.The third resolution concerns a USD 200 million non-compete fee to be paid by MUFG Bank to Shriram Ownership Trust (SOT), the promoter entity. This proposal will be put to vote as an ordinary resolution, with promoters abstaining from voting.Advisory firm Institutional Shareholder Services (ISS) found no concerns with the non-compete fee and clarified that the payment will be made only upon successful completion of the share allotment. ISS added that the fee relates to a genuine restriction preventing promoters from entering competing businesses. Since MUFG Bank pays it directly, not Shriram Finance, it mitigates the risk of value leakage.Another advisory firm, InGovern, also urged shareholders to support the proposal, citing fair pricing, the investor’s strong credentials, and safeguards for Shriram Finance’s core business and brand. InGovern added that the non-compete fee is proportionate to the investment size and includes clearly defined scope and sunset clauses.Live EventsAs of end-September, foreign institutional investors held 49.61% in Shriram Finance, domestic institutional investors 18.65%, promoters 25.39%, and non-institutional public shareholders 6.34%.

Market Trading Guide: Buy IEX and ABB India on Thursday for up to 6% gains,"Nifty ended with marginal losses on Wednesday, marking its third consecutive decline amid selling pressure in auto and energy stocks, even as IT shares provided some support.Rupak De, Senior Technical Analyst at LKP Securities, said the near-term trend remains sluggish, with the Nifty likely to trade in the 26,000–26,300 range. “The Nifty remained volatile during the session, although the trading range was relatively narrow.

Bernstein warns of regulatory storm for IEX as market-coupling case plays out,"Indian Energy Exchangeis “in the midst of a regulatory storm” and faces heightened policy uncertainty even as recent court developments have lifted investor sentiment,Bernstein Researchsaid, maintaining a cautious stance on thepower tradingplatform amid the ongoing market-coupling debate.Bernstein reiterated an 'Underperform' rating onIEX, saying regulatory risks, rather than operating performance, will be the decisive factor for the stock. The brokerage said three issues matter most for IEX:market coupling, transaction charges and trading volumes. While recent legal signals could provide near-term relief, Bernstein warned that structural risks to earnings remain.“Market coupling – IEX presented a strong case in the lastAPTEL hearing, and we see reasonable odds of APTEL asking for a re-evaluation of the timing of market coupling – which could be a temporary positive,” Bernstein said. However, the brokerage cautioned that any delay in coupling could reopen a more damaging debate. “If coupling gets pushed out, we see high chances of a discussion paper on transaction charges proposing a reduction in basis benchmarks and industry ROE norms. This is the biggest reason for our underperform rating.”On operating momentum, the brokerage struck a more constructive tone, saying volumes “should remain supportive with good coal availability and even some renewable plants being forced to sell on the exchange,” in its view.IEX shares rally as tribunal questions frameworkDespite Bernstein’s caution, IEX shares have rallied sharply this week.

New data from tax filings show that ITR-3 filings, which cater to taxpayers with business or trading income, have jumped 45.4% year-on-year, while ITR-2 filings, used by individuals reporting capital gains and investment income, rose 17%.The report added that a notable (8 in 10 or 83.38%) of all ITR-3 filings also reported Capital Gains income, reflecting that traditional salary-onlytax returnis steadily giving way to filings that combine wages with business income, capital gains, derivatives trading and even digital assets.Millennialsaged 25–35 are at the centre of this transition. Forming the backbone of the economy, data shows they now account for 42.3% of all ITR-3 filings. They also make up the largest share of both new and returning trading taxpayers, pointing to a generation that is actively combining jobs with market income and business activity.Millennials dominate both new & returning trader filers, confirming this is a long-term, sticky behavior. They are the most active cohort when it comes to managing risk and finances, Archit Gupta, Founder and CEO ofClearTaxsaid.Gen Ztaxpayers are also showing early signs of similar behaviour. Among filers under the age of 25, ITR-2 filings grew 18% year-on-year, indicating that first-time tax returns are increasingly capturing investment income alongside salaries, stipends or internships. “This shows a real shift in how young Indians build wealth.

"Stock market valuation turns favourable after 5 years, re-rating ahead: Morgan Stanley","Stock market valuationsin India have turned favourable relative to bonds andshort-term ratesfor the first time in nearly five years, setting the stage for a potential re-rating in equities, global brokerage firmMorgan Stanley's equity strategistRidham Desaisaid.In his latest strategy report, Desai expects a combination of cheaper valuations, an upswing in earnings, and a supportive macro-policy mix to drive better equity returns over the next 12–24 months. The brokerage has a target of 95,000 for the Sensex in the base case scenario.Morgan Stanley argues that trailing 12‑month equity performance is the worst in India’s recorded history on a relative basis, while valuation metrics such as its modified earnings yield gap are approaching past trough levels that have typically preceded strong market phases. On key relative gauges that compare equity valuations with short-term interest rates, the firm says the indicators have “turned up” after several years, implying that stocks are now inexpensive versus cash and bonds and that the balance of risk and reward has shifted back in favour of equities.The report notes that multiple macro indicators, which historically lead equity returns, have swung into positive territory, including a bullish steepening of the yield curve, a rise in the money multiplier, and a widening gap between nominal GDP growth and the policy rate.The rupee is also considered undervalued on the real effective exchange rate, a setup that has often coincided with stronger forward returns from the Sensex, even though the historical relationship has weakened more recently.Live EventsOn fundamentals, Morgan Stanley expects a “sharp turn” in earnings growth driven by an explicit reflation effort from the Reserve Bank of India and the government via rate cuts, CRR cuts, deregulation and liquidity infusion, as well as front-loaded capex and around Rs 1.5 trillion of GST rate cuts skewed to mass consumption.Its proprietary earnings indicators point to improving",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/stock-market-valuation-turns-favourable-after-5-years-re-rating-ahead-morgan-stanley/articleshow/126389557.cms,economictimes,2026-01-22,neutral
Monopoly business: 5 reasons why SBI Securities says subscribe to Bharat Coking Coal IPO,"Bharat Coking Coal Limited (BCCL),Coal India’s coking coal arm, is heading to the market with a Rs 1,071 crore IPO at a time when domestic steel demand remains resilient and India continues to grapple with a structural shortage of coking coal.The IPO, priced in the Rs 21 to 23 range, opens on January 9 and closes on January 13. At the upper end of the band, BCCL will command a post-issue market capitalisation of about Rs 10,711 crore. The issue is entirely an offer for sale by promoter Coal India, which will pare its stake to 90% from 100%.Here are five reasons whySBISecurities says subscribe to theBharat Coking Coal IPO.1)BCCL is India’s largest producer of coking coal and the country’s only meaningful source of prime coking coal. As of April 2024, it held estimated reserves of around 7.91 billion tonnes, accounting for roughly 21.5% of India’s coking coal resources.2)In FY25, the company contributed nearly 58.5% of domestic coking coal production, operating 34 mines across Jharkhand and West Bengal, according to the offer documents.Live EventsBrokerage SBI Securities says the company’s strategic importance stems from India’s widening coking coal demand supply gap, driven by rising steel capacity.“BCCL’s dominant reserve position and parentage under Coal India provide it with operational scale, logistical advantages and access to capital and technical expertise,” it said while recommending a subscribe for the IPO.3)A key growth lever is capacity expansion in coal beneficiation. BCCL currently operates washeries with an owned capacity of 13.65 million tonnes per annum and is in the process of adding three new washeries with a combined capacity of 7 million tonnes per annum, along with the renovation of the Moonidih washery. Once completed, total washery capacity is expected to rise to 20.65 million tonnes per annum, improving realisations and product mix over time.4)Financially, BCCL has delivered sharp margin expansion over the past two years, aided by operating le",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/monopoly-business-5-reasons-why-sbi-securities-says-subscribe-to-bharat-coking-coal-ipo/articleshow/126389444.cms,economictimes,2026-01-22,neutral

"Silver prices take Rs 5,500 hit, tumble 2% today. Should investors buy this dip?","After opening in the red, silver prices extended losses on January 7, sliding about 2%, or by Rs 5,511, to trade around Rs 2,53,300 per kilogram on the MCX, as investors booked profits a day after the precious metal touched a one-week high. The pullback comes after a stellar run in 2025, during which silver prices surged by as much as 147%. With today’s dip, what should investors do?Ponmudi R, CEO of Enrich Money, said that MCX Silver is trading near Rs 2,58,836, sustaining its bullish channel, with every pullback attracting aggressive buying interest. “Holding above Rs 2,55,000 keeps the upside momentum firmly intact. Sustained strength above Rs 2,59,000 could drive a swift move towards Rs 2,64,000 to Rs 2,75,000, while the Rs 2,55,000 to Rs 2,52,000 band remains a key accumulation zone. Silver continues to outperform as a high-beta play within the broader precious metals uptrend,” he added.The recent rally was driven by strong safe-haven demand following heightened global tensions after the US captured Venezuela’s president. Adding to uncertainty, the US President’s renewed push to assert control over Greenland has intensified frictions with the European Union. Investors are now awaiting US payroll data for further cues on the Federal Reserve’s interest rate outlook.For those already holding silver, experts believe the outlook remains broadly positive, supported by global monetary easing, geopolitical uncertainty and structural demand. However, after the spectacular rally of 2025, prudence suggests a balanced approach, booking partial profits to lock in gains while maintaining core holdings as a hedge against volatility and inflation.“With strong momentum, silver prices could test the $100 per ounce level in 2026,” says Hareesh V of Geojit Investments Ltd. “Technical breakouts, structural supply deficits and surging green-tech and industrial demand are key drivers.

The move comes against the backdrop of aluminium prices hitting their highest level in more than three years, withLondon Metal Exchangeprices breaching the $3,000-per-tonne mark to trade at $3,082.Global prices provide the sparkThe rally in aluminium has been driven by tight supply conditions, as a cap on smelting capacity in China and production constraints in Europe due to elevated electricity costs have weighed on global inventories. At the same time, demand prospects remain strong, supported by sustained requirements from the construction and renewable energy sectors, Bloomberg said in a note.The improving global outlook has reinforced expectations of a tighter market ahead. Last month, CNBC TV-18 reported that Brijendra Pratak Singh, managing director of NALCO, said the global aluminium market is expected to move into a supply deficit in 2026 and 2027 as demand continues to rise across multiple sectors. “The demands are increasing from the EV sector, construction sector, power sector, and now huge data centres are coming,” Singh said.Live EventsNALCO Q2 resultsThe recent surge also builds on a solid set of earnings.

Here’s the full list. With a target price of Rs 474 per share, the brokerage implies an upside potential of a massive 221% from current market levels. Its revenue is expected to rise at an 18.8% CAGR over FY26 to FY28, driven by sales of vanillin & blends. The EBITDA margin is expected to expand, from 10% in FY25F to 21.8% in FY28F, resulting in a robust 56.8% EBITDA CAGR. InCred Equities has a target price of Rs 1,850, translating to an upside potential of 94%. Margins are benefiting from the normalisation of fuel costs and a decline in maize prices following the kharif harvest season. As a result, the company’s manufacturing margin for ethanol and ENA improved sharply to Rs 5 per litre in 2QFY26, from Rs 2 per litre in FY25, with further gradual improvement expected through FY26. The brokerage has a target price of Rs 2,051, implying an upside of 70.4%, InCred Equities said in a note. Strong demand in mining, infrastructure, and specialty chemicals sectors is expected to continue driving growth, bolstered by India’s coal production growth target of 1.5 billion tonnes by FY30, increasing TAN consumption. With a price target of Rs 4,100 per share, analysts forecast an upside potential of 34.1%. The company is well-placed to participate in a broader recovery in the FMCG industry. With the outlook for 2H expected to be better for FMCG majors in terms of volume growth, the company should benefit. The brokerage has assigned a target price of Rs 325 per share, implying an upside potential of 24%.

Emmvee Photovoltaic shares gain 17% in 2 sessions. What’s powering the rally?,"Shares ofEmmvee Photovoltaicrallied as much as 8.5% to hit an intraday high of Rs 217 on January 7, extending gains for a second consecutive session. With today’s move, the stock has surged 17% over the past two sessions.The gains come after global brokerage firm Jefferies initiated coverage on the stock with a Buy rating and a target price of Rs 320, a 60% upside from current levels, citing strong growth visibility, policy support and attractive valuations.Analysts at Jefferies suggest that India's annual solar installations grow at a 24% CAGR between FY25 and FY28, largely aided by falling solar tariffs, rising power demand and the increasing adoption of battery energy storage systems.According to Jefferies, solar power tariffs have consistently remained below the cost of new thermal power over the past four years, making solar the preferred option for utilities and industrial consumers.The recent discovery of solar-plus-storage tariffs in the Rs 3–3.5 per unit range has further strengthened the renewable energy proposition. These tariffs imply battery storage costs of Rs 4.5–5 per unit, which still compare favourably with marginal thermal power tariffs of Rs 5.4–5.8 per unit. Notably, solar-plus-storage contracts lock in prices for 25 years, unlike thermal power where costs escalate annually.Live EventsAgainst this backdrop, Jefferies expects solar to emerge as the dominant renewable energy source in India, with annual installations projected to rise to 65 GW by FY28, from around 34 GW in FY25. Policy support continues to be a key driver for domestic manufacturers, with measures such as the Approved List of Models and Manufacturers (ALMM) and domestic content requirements for public sector projects effectively reserving a significant portion of the market for Indian players.Within this context, Emmvee stands out due to its early adoption of high-efficiency TOPCon cell technology. The company is among the first in India to operationalise large-scale TOPCon cell ca",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/emmvee-photovoltaic-shares-gain-17-in-2-sessions-whats-powering-the-rally/articleshow/126386975.cms,economictimes,2026-01-22,neutral
"IDFC First Bank shares can rally 23%, says Nomura after initiating coverage with Buy call","Private sector lenderIDFC First Bank sharesgained over 1% to Rs 86.20 per share after international brokerage firm Nomura initiated coverage with a Buy call, citing positive growth levers in the coming quarters.With a target price of Rs 105, analysts implied an upside potential of 23.5% from current market levels.Nomura said growth visibility remains strong, with loans and deposits expected to clock CAGRs of 20% and 22%, respectively, over FY26-28F. The bank’s fee income profile, at over 2% of average assets, remains superior to peers.In addition, a 35 basis points decline in credit costs is likely to support a sharp improvement in profitability, lifting RoA and RoE to 1.2% and 1.8% by FY28, respectively, from 0.6% and 5.4% in FY26. This earnings acceleration is expected to translate into a sector-leading EPS CAGR of 67% over FY26-28F.Operating expenses remained elevated during FY19-25 as the bank invested across branches, manpower, technology and multiple new businesses. Operating leverage is now becoming visible at the segment level across retail liabilities, assets and credit cards, though this has not yet fully reflected in headline ratios due to strong growth in these segments. As growth normalises and scale benefits kick in, cost efficiency is expected to improve, with cost-to-assets and cost-to-income ratios declining to 5.1% and 64% by FY28F, from 5.6% and 71% in FY26F, respectively.Live EventsNet interest margin (NIM) pressure witnessed over FY25-H1FY26, driven by repo-linked repricing and loan mix effects, is largely absorbed. As term deposits reprice, NIMs are expected to bottom out in FY26, recover gradually through FY27 and stabilise thereafter. Potential savings account rate cuts provide additional upside, with a 50-100 bps reduction potentially adding 17-33 bps to margins and 12-23 bps to RoAs.Asset quality stress has largely been confined to the microfinance (MFI) portfolio, where the bank has already taken corrective measures.

InCred Equities' top picks: 9 largecap stocks with upside potential of up to 38% in 2026,"After a volatile 2025 marked by persistent foreign institutional investor selling, market sentiment has turned optimistic.

For using in classrooms and any other media for educational and awareness activities, the data should be at least three months old. The regulator is now proposing a uniform 30-day lag for sharing price data for all educational and awareness purposes.The move comes in the wake of the regulator banning financial influencer Avadhut Sathe of Avadhut Sathe Trading Academy from the securities market for offering unregistered investment advisory and research analyst services.

Top NBFCs seek RBI nod to raise retail deposits,"MUMBAI: Large non-banking finance companies (NBFCs) have urged the central bank to allow them to raise deposits from retail investors-a move they say would create a level playing field among finance companies and improve transmission of policy rates, people familiar with the matter told ET.This request was conveyed by select finance companies to the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) governorSanjay Malhotra, during a closed-door meeting held on Monday.Except for a few NBFCs with legacy licences, most NBFCs are barred from raising retail deposits.Bajaj Finance,Shriram Finance, and Mahindra Finance are among the few NBFCs that are permitted to accept retail deposits.

RBI proposes to cap banks' dividend payout at 75% of PAT,"Kolkata: TheReserve Bank of India(RBI) Tuesday proposed to raise the dividend payout cap for banks to 75% of the net profit from the earlier 40% rule. It also wants bank boards to oversee the asset quality and provisioning gaps, capital projection and long-term growth plans before declaring a dividend.The regulator has laid down a graded structure of dividend payment based on banks' common equity tier 1 (CET1) capital levels in a draft proposal and inviting comments on it by February 5.Stronger banks with more than 20% CET1 would be allowed to pay 100% of adjusted net profit, which will be the net profit minus net non-performing assets for the dividend payment year, the regulator said in a statement on its website. This would, however, be subject to the75% dividend payout limit.Systemically important banks -State Bank of India(SBI),HDFC BankandICICI Bank- would need to have even stronger CET1 ratios if they plan to pay 100% dividend of their adjusted net profit.For instance, SBI would need a minimum 20.8% CET1 ratio for this, while the minimum CET1 ratios HDFC Bank and ICICI Bank would be 20.4% and 20.2%, respectively, showed the calculations by the regulator/analysts.Live EventsMeanwhile, banks with less than 8% CET1 would not be permitted to declare dividends at all.These directions shall come into force from the financial year 2026-27, the RBI said.To be sure, banks -- both Indian and those of foreign origin operating locally in a branch mode -- need to be profitable and should meet the minimum capital adequacy norm to declare dividends.Foreign banks operating in India in the branch mode can remit dividends or surplus without prior approval of the RBI. However, if excess remittance is found on audit, the head office of that foreign bank needs to return the excess remittance and make good the shortfall, the regulator said.For local banks too, overstatement of profit would need deduction.

"Sebi proposes uniform 30-day lag for sharing, use of price data for education","Market regulator Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) has proposed a uniform 30-day lag for both sharing and usage of price data for educational and awareness activities. In a consultation paper released on Tuesday, the regulator noted that the 30-day lag would suffice to protect against misuse of exchange data while keeping the education content relevant.Currently, stock exchanges share live data only for the purpose of trading and its related activities. The regulator prescribed a one-day time lag for educational and awareness activities through a circular issued on May 24, 2024. Subsequently, Sebi’s circular dated January 29, 2025 further tightened the framework by specifying that entities engaged solely in education may use market data only with a three-month lag.While both circulars address data usage, their objectives differ. The May 2024 circular permits limited data sharing for education with a one-day delay, whereas the January 2025 circular governs how old such data must be when used exclusively for educational purposes, prescribing a three-month delay.Sebi received stakeholder comments that the one-day time lag was too short, and that there were possible cases of misuse of one-day time lag data, making out a case for increasing the time lag to a larger period.Meanwhile, Sebi's internal deliberations took the regulator to a conclusion that three-month lag was too long and that the educational input could be more efficient if the period is reduced.Live Events""In this regard, it is felt that a time lag of 30 days for both sharing and usage of price data would suffice the purpose of protecting against misuse of exchange data as well as keeping the education content relevant,"" the consultation paper said.The paper also proposed that persons engaged solely in education will continue to abide by the prohibited activities provisions mentioned in the January 2025 circular and that all the other provisions will remain unchanged.Sebi has sought public feedb",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/sebi-proposes-uniform-30-day-lag-for-sharing-use-of-price-data-for-education/articleshow/126375667.cms,economictimes,2026-01-22,neutral

To do so, we screened BSE small-cap companies that reported strong year-on-year sales and profit growth of over 10% in the September quarter, while sustaining healthy profit margins above 10%. We further narrowed the list to companies that saw a rise in mutual fund shareholding during the September quarter compared with the previous quarter, excluding banking and financial stocks.Applying these criteria to the BSE small-cap universe resulted in a pool of around 74 stocks.

Rekha Jhunjhunwala likely exits Canara Bank after taking home multibagger returns,"Veteran investorRekha Jhunjhunwalahas likely exited her holding inCanara Bank, marking the end of a profitable chapter in a long investment journey in the state-run lender. According to the latest shareholding data for the December quarter, her stake in the bank has fallen below 1% for the first time, a position that delivered multibagger returns over several years. The data was not publicly available to find out the exact returns Jhunjhunwalas took home in this investment.Jhunjhunwala's involvement with Canara Bank dates back to August 2021, when Rakesh Jhunjhunwala first picked up a stake in the bank as part of a broader bullish view on public sector banks (PSBs). At the end of the September 2025 quarter, Rekha still held around 1.57% of the bank's equity, having increased her holding marginally by about 0.1% during that period.The recent exit comes after the stock delivered strong gains, rallying nearly 60% over the last year, outperforming several peers in the banking pack.Her late husband, the late ace investor Rakesh Jhunjhunwala, was widely known for his optimistic stance onPSU banks.

"Gold vs stocks, Nifty targets and 10 other market myths debunked by DSP Mutual Fund","Two of the biggest questions dominating investors’ minds now are whether gold will continue to outperform stocks and what the target for the Nifty is in 2026. DSP Mutual Fund has addressed these and 10 other topics in its latest NETRA report, taking direct aim at some of the market’s most persistent beliefs and arguing that investors anchor too heavily to myths about gold, GDP, flows, smallcaps, SIP timing and index targets instead of hard data.Here are 12 such myths:1) Gold is dead money and can’t beat equitiesThe widely held view that gold is a useless “pet rock” that always trails equities is belied by 21st-century data, where bullion has actually outperformed every major stock market in local currency terms, including India and the US. In India, only about a quarter of NSE 500 stocks have beaten gold on a market-cap-weighted basis over this period, making a zero-gold allocation look more like a bias than a rational decision.2) Gold has replaced equities as the only asset worth owningThe reverse belief, that gold is now the only game in town, also fails the data test, as five-year rolling returns show equities beating gold around half the time in India and the US, and more often in Europe and Hong Kong. There have been long stretches when staying invested in diversified indices would have delivered better outcomes than holding just gold, reinforcing that bullion is a useful diversifier, not a one-way ticket to wealth.Live Events3) Diversification dilutes returns and is “di-worse-ification”The claim that spreading money across assets drags down performance is challenged by DSP’s back-tests showing a 50–20–15–15 mix of domestic equity, debt, international equity and gold delivering equity-like returns with much lower volatility across markets. Outside the US, this diversified basket has even beaten pure local equities in nominal terms over 20-year horizons, with significantly lower standard deviation in countries like India and China.4) High GDP growth automaticall",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/gold-vs-stocks-nifty-targets-and-10-other-market-myths-debunked-by-dsp-mutual-fund/articleshow/126368503.cms,economictimes,2026-01-22,neutral

Rs 1 lakh crore wipeout! RIL shares sink nearly 5% to log worst single-day fall since June 2024,"Reliance IndustriesLimited (RIL) shares plunged 5% to an intraday low of Rs 1,497.05 on the BSE on Tuesday after the company denied a Bloomberg report that claimed three vessels carrying Russian crude oil were headed to its Jamnagar refinery, calling the report “blatantly untrue.”This marks the stock’s biggest intraday fall since June 4, 2024. The stock slipped below its 50-day moving average, eroding over Rs 1 lakh crore in market capitalisation during the session. The stock ended 4.30% lower at Rs 1509.55 apiece on the BSE.Reliancealso emerged as the largest drag on the Nifty 50, contributing to a decline of about 82 points in the benchmark index.In a statement posted on X, the company said its Jamnagar refinery has not received any Russian oil cargo in the past three weeks and is not expecting any Russian crude deliveries in January. RIL added that it was “deeply pained” that its denial was ignored, leading to the publication of what it described as an incorrect report that tarnished its image.— RIL_Updates (@RIL_Updates)Live EventsThe Bloomberg report, citing Kpler data, had suggested that three vessels laden with Russian crude were heading to Reliance’s Jamnagar refinery. Reliance, which was earlier India’s largest buyer of discounted Russian oil following the Russia-Ukraine war, has now paused such purchases.According to Reuters, with Reliance halting Russian crude intake, India’s oil imports from Russia are expected to decline further in January. The report added that Russian oil flows to India have already slowed due to tighter U.S. and European Union sanctions, with imports falling to a three-year low of about 1.2 million barrels per day in December, down roughly 40% from a June peak of around 2 million barrels per day.Despite the company’s clarification, Reliance shares remained under pressure through the session amid heavy trade volumes, as investors reacted to the news flow and broader market weakness.(Disclaimer: Recommendations, suggestions, views and ",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/reliance-industries-shares-decline-4-amid-heavy-volumes-emerges-as-third-biggest-drag-on-nifty/articleshow/126366034.cms,economictimes,2026-01-22,neutral

5 IPOs opening this week. GMPs suggest up to 70% listing gain,"The IPO market is off to a steady start in the new year with 5 IPOs opening this week. Early grey market signals suggest strong investor interest in select names, with indications of listing gains of up to 70% in one marquee issue. The Bharat Coking Coal IPO stands out as the most tracked issue of the week. Grey market premium for the stock is hovering around Rs 16–17, implying potential listing gains of over 70% against the issue price. The Coal India subsidiary has attracted attention due to its strategic importance and strong sector positioning. Among SME offerings, Gabion Technologies has generated strong early interest. The stock is commanding a grey market premium of around Rs 30, translating into a potential listing gain of about 37%. Victory Electric Vehicles opens this week on the SME platform with a fixed-price issue. While there is no active grey market premium yet, the issue is being watched closely due to its exposure to the electric mobility theme. Yajur Fibres, another SME issue opening this week. Though grey market activity is currently muted, investors tracking sustainability-linked businesses are keeping the issue on their radar. Defrail Technologies rounds out the week's IPO calendar. Grey market indicators are yet to reflect any premium, suggesting a more cautious approach from investors. The IPO calendar for the week may not be crowded, but select offerings -- especially Bharat Coking Coal and Gabion Technologies -- are drawing strong attention.

"Rs 13,000 crore gone! Why Trent shares crashed 8% despite 17% Q3 growth","Trent share pricenosedived up to 8.3% to Rs 4,060.65 on BSE on Tuesday, wiping out Rs 13,000 crore in market value, even as the Tata Group retailer posted a 17% year-on-year revenue jump to Rs 5,220 crore in the December quarter. The bloodbath came as investors punished the Zudio and Westside operator for what analysts called a worrying deceleration in growth momentum.The market's brutal verdict reflects mounting concerns over weakening same-store sales and slowingrevenue per square foot, a critical metric that strips out the boost from aggressive store expansion. Despite adding 48 Zudio stores and 17 Westside outlets during the quarter, the company's ability to generate sales from existing space continues to deteriorate sharply.UBS captured investor anxiety with its blunt assessment: ""No respite from weaker growth trajectory. Q3 weak again at 17%, misses expectations."" The brokerage maintained its Buy rating, but the damage was done as the stock's premium valuation left no room for disappointment.Citi, which has a Sell rating with a target price of Rs 4,350, highlighted the core problem plaguing Trent's performance. Average revenue per square foot declined 15.7% year-on-year, marking the third consecutive quarter of double-digit deterioration. The firm noted that revenue per square foot in the third quarter ""saw an adverse impact from an early festive season while also benefiting from a relatively weak base,"" with growth of just 1.5% compared to 4.9% in the previous quarter.The company's reported standalone revenue growth of 16.9% came in ahead of Citi's estimate of 15.3%, but that marginal beat was entirely driven by store additions rather than improved productivity. Citi pointed out that higher store additions—Zudio opened 48 net new stores versus their estimate of 40, while Westside added 17 against an expectation of 18—led to better-than-expected revenue growth.Live EventsMorgan Stanley, which maintains an Overweight rating with a target of Rs 5,456, noted that",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/rs-13000-crore-gone-why-trent-shares-crashed-8-despite-17-q3-growth/articleshow/126365711.cms,economictimes,2026-01-22,neutral
"Kotak Bank, Trent among 5 Nifty stocks with highest EPS upgrades in December","The last year has been a mixed phase for the equity markets. Between December 2024 and December 2025, the Nifty delivered returns of 8.3%, even as earnings expectations weakened. FY26E and FY27E EPS estimates were cut by 7.8% and 6.5% over the past 12 months. However, December 2025 marked a small but important shift. EPS estimates for FY26E and FY27E rose 0.3% and 0.5% month-on-month, suggesting early signs of stabilisation. Against this backdrop, a handful of stocks stood out with clear upgrades. Source: JM Financial Kotak Mahindra Bank saw the highest EPS upgrade in December 2025, with estimates raised by 2.2%. The upgrade reflects improving confidence in asset quality, stable margins and the bank’s relatively conservative balance sheet. ICICI Bank recorded a 1.5% upgrade in EPS estimates during the month. Strong loan growth, controlled credit costs and steady improvement in return ratios have kept analysts positive. The bank continues to benefit from operating leverage and scale, even as system-wide growth moderates. Bharat Electronics saw EPS upgrades of 1.2% in December. The improvement is driven by strong execution of defence orders, healthy order inflows and sustained margin performance. Analysts are increasingly factoring in long-term visibility from government-led defence spending. Trent reported a 1.0% EPS upgrade for the month. Despite concerns around near-term margins, analysts remain encouraged by store expansion, Zudio’s scale-up and steady consumption trends. The upgrade suggests confidence that growth momentum can offset execution risks. Grasim saw a 0.7% EPS upgrade in December. The revision reflects a stabilising outlook across its cement, chemicals and new-age businesses. While the upgrade is modest, it signals improving confidence after a phase of earnings downgrades. In a month where earnings cuts still outnumbered upgrades, these five stocks stood out for attracting incremental optimism from analysts. The upgrades suggest that selective earning",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/kotak-bank-trent-among-5-nifty-stocks-with-highest-eps-upgrades-in-december/slideshow/126365671.cms,economictimes,2026-01-22,neutral
Hindustan Copper shares jump 4% to 52-week high as copper hits record levels. Can rally sustain in 2026?,"Shares ofHindustan Copperrallied as much 4% to its fresh 52-week high of Rs 574 on January 6, after the globalcopper pricesscaled to fresh peaks fuelled by a renewed rush to ship metal to the US fired up bullish traders and investors. With today’s surge, the stock is up 11% in 2026, rising for all 4 sessions of the year.Benchmark prices on theLondon Metal Exchangesurged as much as 4.4% to $13,000 per metric ton, the latest in a series of leaps higher that have lifted copper more than 20% since mid-November.The rally has been driven by a scramble to ship copper into the US, as the looming threat of import tariffs under President Donald Trump has pushed US copper prices to trade at a sustained premium to those on the LME. This arbitrage has raised concerns about potential copper shortages in other parts of the world and has further emboldened bullish investors, who are already positive on the metal due to its critical role across key growth themes ranging from data centres to electric-vehicle batteries.Can prices sustain? Goldman Sachs offers a slightly bearish view as it expects the London Metals Exchange (LME) copper price to remain in a range of $10,000-$11,000 “as strong global demand growth from the grid and power infrastructure, backed by investment in strategic sectors such as AI and defence” keep prices from falling below $10,000. The LME copper price is forecast to average $10,710 in the first half of 2026.“While the global copper market has been in surplus this year, a combination of limited growth in the supply from mines and rising structural demand from power infrastructure should create more of a balance between supply and demand next year, and lift prices beyond 2026,” the international brokerage said.Live EventsHowever, one factor that could lead to higher demand on the London copper market next year is the potential for the US to place tariffs on refined copper imports.

Nifty breaks record high twice in 40 days. Will this rally endure or fizzle out again?,"India's benchmark indexNiftyhas scaled fresh record highs twice in just over 40 days, raising a familiar question for investors -- is this rally different from the one that fizzled out earlier, or is another bout of profit-booking around the corner?The benchmark index crossed the 26,300 mark in early January 2026 after first hitting an all-time high in late November, driven by strong performances in banking, auto and energy stocks. This time, however, analysts say the rally is being supported by a healthier mix ofearnings visibility,domestic demandand improving balance sheets rather than just liquidity.According to Sourav Choudhary, Managing Director at Raghunath Capital, the current up-move rests on firmer fundamentals than earlier momentum-led phases.""Unlike past rallies that were largely driven by liquidity and global risk-on sentiment, this one is anchored in earnings growth and macro stability,"" Choudhary said.He pointed out that banks, industrials, manufacturing and capital goods companies are likely to report steadyprofit growth, supported by government capital expenditure and a gradual formalisation of the economy.Live EventsEarnings strength across key sectors has been one of the biggest pillars of support. Financials continue to benefit from improving asset quality and credit growth, while autos and manufacturing have seen stable demand. Infrastructure-linked companies are also reporting strong order books as public spending remains robust.Another key factor has been the steady flow of domestic money into equities. Monthly SIP investments remain elevated, providing a cushion even when foreign portfolio investor flows turn volatile. Analysts say this has reduced the market's dependence on overseas liquidity, making corrections shallower.Khushi Mistry, Research Analyst at Bonanza, said the latest rally was backed by a broad-based sectoral move.

Groww shares gain 3% as Motilal Oswal initiates coverage with Buy rating. Here are 4 reasons,"Shares of newly-listedBillionbrains Garage Ventures, the parent company ofGroww, rallied as much as 3.2% to their day’s high of Rs 160 on the BSE on Tuesday after Motilal Oswal initiated coverage with a Buy rating, citing strong growth prospects in the coming quarters.With a price target of Rs 185, the domestic brokerage implies an upside potential of nearly 20% from current market levels. To be sure, shares of the company are trading 20% below its all- time high of Rs 194. Here’s why experts are bullish on the counter.Market share gains:Analysts say Groww continues to maintain a strong competitive position in the broking space, with its cash ADTO (average daily turnover) market share holding steady at 23–24%. The platform has also made sharp gains in the derivatives segment, where market share has risen to 14.4% from 9.7%, despite operating in a challenging regulatory environment. Notably, even after increasing the minimum brokerage to Rs 5 from Rs 2, active users in the cash segment have continued to trend higher across segments, indicating price inelasticity and providing Groww with a clear pricing lever to cushion against potential future headwinds.The company is rolling out new trading tools targeted at “power traders” to deepen engagement and improve monetization. Supported by continuous product innovation, Groww’s higher-value customer base is expanding, resulting in larger order sizes and improved revenue yield. While the share of brokerage revenue is expected to moderate to 67% by FY28 from 85% in FY25, absolute brokerage revenues are projected to grow at a 16% CAGR over FY25–28.Affluent-led wealth management entry:Groww’s affluent user base has expanded at nearly twice the pace of its overall platform growth, with around 0.3 million affluent customers accounting for approximately 33% of total assets on the platform.

"'Too cheap to ignore': Jefferies initiates coverage on Emmvee Photovoltaic, sees 70% upside","India's solar manufacturing story is entering a phase of rapid scale-up, and Jefferies believes select domestic players are well placed to benefit from this transition. In a new report, the global brokerage has initiated coverage onEmmvee Photovoltaic Powerwith a Buy rating and a target price of Rs 320, a 70% upside from current levels, citing strong growth visibility, policy support and attractive valuations.Jefferies expects India's annual solar installations to grow at a 24% CAGR between FY25 and FY28, driven by falling solar tariffs, rising power demand and the increasing adoption of battery energy storage systems.According to the brokerage, solar power tariffs have consistently stayed below the cost of new thermal power over the past four years, making solar the preferred choice for utilities and industrial users.The recent discovery of solar-plus-storage tariffs in the range of Rs 3-3.5 per unit has further strengthened the case for renewables. Jefferies notes that these tariffs imply battery storage costs of Rs 4.5-5 per unit, which still compares favourably with marginal thermal power tariffs of Rs 5.4-5.8 per unit. Importantly, solar-plus-storage contracts lock in prices for 25 years, unlike thermal power where costs rise annually.Against this backdrop, Jefferies sees solar emerging as the dominant renewable energy source in India. It estimates annual solar installations to rise to 65 GW by FY28 from about 34 GW in FY25.Live EventsPolicy support remains a key driver for domestic manufacturers. Government rules such as the Approved List of Models and Manufacturers (ALMM) and domestic content requirements for public sector projects have effectively reserved a large part of the market for Indian manufacturers.This has led to a shortage of domestic solar cells, pushing up module prices and improving profitability for local players. Jefferies expects similar policy protection to eventually extend to upstream segments like ingots and wafers.Emmvee, according to t",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/too-cheap-to-ignore-jefferies-initiates-coverage-on-emmvee-photovoltaic-sees-70-upside/articleshow/126355024.cms,economictimes,2026-01-22,neutral

Among Nifty200 stocks, eight companies stand out with enterprise values significantly higher than their market capitalisation (EV as of September ’25), based on StockEdge’s valuation scan data.This could also mean the company has limited cash reserves or a disproportionately high enterprise value compared to its equity, possibly affecting investor confidence and the company’s market value.

Fresh curbs on insurance commissions likely as expense breaches mount in FY25,"Less than two years after IRDAI scrapped product-wisecommission caps, regulators warn rising distribution costs are inflating premiums. RBI’s Financial Stability Report too echoes concerns. A council-level committee is reviewing compensation norms as breaches surge, sparking debate on reinstating ceilings. In FY25, several life and non-life insurers exceeded expense limits, seekingregulatory forbearanceamid mounting scrutiny.“A committee has been formed to review distribution compensation in the insurance industry amid concerns that commissions have surged sharply since the removal of caps, with discussions underway on whether ceilings should be brought back,” said a source close to the development. “No decision has been taken yet, but the debate has intensified after commission payouts in the sector rose in FY25.”Under the IRDAI (Expenses of Management, including Commission, of Insurers) Regulations, 2024, insurers are required to operate within expense caps linked to product structure, premium-paying term and the duration of business. In FY25, many insurance companies breached the limit. In the life insurance segment, only 17 of the 25 insurers stayed within the prescribed limits, while eight exceeded the thresholds on an overall basis across participating, non-participating and linked products.Industry executives say the discussion is not about reverting to the earlier regime, but about designing a new framework. They say that going back to product-wise commission caps would be a step backward, they argue, given changes in product design, persistency norms and distribution economics.Executives say data shows a positive correlation between high first-year commissions and mis-selling complaints in the first policy year. While insurers believe that reasonable commissions are necessary to improve insurance penetration, they also say that overpaying distributors encourages aggressive sales practices, benefiting intermediaries while policyholders and insurers bear the ",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/fresh-curbs-on-insurance-commissions-likely-as-expense-breaches-mount-in-fy25/articleshow/126363554.cms,economictimes,2026-01-22,neutral

Almost the entire gain came fromReliance Industries, which alone added nearly Rs 4.79 lakh crore in value.The gain was on the back of a rare alignment of positive triggers across telecom, energy and consumer businesses. Reliance Jio regained momentum after a dull 2024, and brokerages turned more bullish, with expectations of steady revenue and profit growth.That said, most other Reliance group stocks lost value. Network18 (-Rs 4,319 crore), Just Dial (-Rs 2282 crore), Alok Industries and cable companies like Hathway (-Rs 2.74 crore) and Den Networks (-Rs 597 crore) all ended the year lower.

IndusInd Bank among Axis Direct’s three weekly technical bets. Check list,"Axis Direct says Indian equities remain in a constructive phase, with the Nifty 50 closing at a fresh all-time high as buying interest emerged near key supports and momentum indicators turned positive. The brokerage expects the benchmark to trade with a positive bias within a defined range, with strength also evident in the Bank Nifty as higher highs and higher lows reinforce the uptrend. Against this backdrop, Axis Direct has identified select stocks offering medium-term trading opportunities over the next three to four weeks. Axis Direct says IndusInd Bank has delivered a “decisive breakout above the 893 level,” completing an ascending triangle pattern that signals the start of a medium-term uptrend. The brokerage notes that the stock is sustaining a higher high higher low structure above its rising trendline, while momentum indicators show the weekly RSI “trending higher, holding above its reference line.” Axis Direct says this setup “points to sustained buying interest with scope for further upside in the medium term.” Axis Direct highlights that DOMS Industries has seen a “decisive breakout from a prolonged symmetrical triangle consolidation,” confirmed by a strong bullish candlestick after nearly a year of consolidation.

"Tata Motors CV shares may rally 16%, says InCred; 4 reasons behind the ‘Add’ call","Shares of Tata Motors’ commercial vehicle business could rally as much as 16% from current levels, according to InCred Equities, which has initiated coverage on the stock with an Add rating, citing robust growth levers over the coming quarters. The domestic brokerage has set a price target of Rs 513 and outlined four key factors underpinning its bullish stance on the automobile major.CV upcycle just startingThe commercial vehicle (CV) business cycle appears to be turning, with momentum expected to build after a prolonged downcycle that played out over six quarters between April 2024 and July 2025. The Goods and Services Tax (GST) rate cut in September 2025 has significantly improved business economics for small transporters, triggering a revival in new truck demand.Savings from lower costs of tyres, lubricants and spare parts are expected to improve cash flows for small truck operators. Meanwhile, a reduction in vehicle prices should shorten payback periods, as these benefits are likely to be retained under the reverse charge mechanism of the GST regime. In addition, medium-term drivers such as easing interest rates and an improving Index of Industrial Production (IIP) are expected to sustain the demand recovery through FY28.Strong brand pullTata Motors is seen as better positioned to benefit from the recovery and potentially reverse its recent market share losses in the CV segment. Market share erosion during the downturn was more pronounced in trucks below 16 tonnes. However, with the demand revival likely to be led by small transporters and focused on small and medium trucks, Tata Motors’ wide product portfolio and strong brand recall offer a meaningful opportunity to regain lost share as the cycle turns.Sustained profitabilityA healthier demand environment is likely to result in lower discounts across the industry, supporting margin sustainability, the brokerage said in a note dated January 5.Live Events“Tata Motors’ EBITDA margin is marginally lower than that o",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/tata-motors-cv-shares-may-rally-16-says-incred-4-reasons-behind-the-add-call/articleshow/126349223.cms,economictimes,2026-01-22,neutral

It is one of the top five global manufacturers of white oils and commands a 26.5% market share in India and 9.6% globally.While the company did not issue any exchange filing or announcement to trigger the sharp rally, market participants may have speculated that rising tensions between the US and Venezuela, a major oil-producing nation, may have pushed investors to turn bullish on domestic oil-related counters, with Gandhar Oil being one of the key beneficiaries due to its niche positioning and scale in the white oil segment.The developments come at a time when global crude markets are closely watching potential supply disruptions, making oil-linked plays on the domestic bourses increasingly attractive.Also read:BEL, HAL, other defence stocks jump up to 5% after US raids Venezuela(Disclaimer: Recommendations, suggestions, views and opinions given by the experts are their own.

"5 stocks YES Securities expects to shine in 2026, with upsides up to 26%","Indian equities are entering 2026 against the backdrop of a structural upshift in the economy amid a changing global environment, according to YES Securities. The brokerage views select companies as well-positioned to navigate global uncertainty, thanks to strong balance sheets, an improving business mix, and sector-specific tailwinds. YES Securities has identified five high-conviction stocks, assigning 'Buy' ratings with upside potential of up to 26% YES Securities has a 'Buy' on Samvardhan Motherson International with a target price of Rs 143, implying a 21% upside from current levels. The brokerage highlights a resilient outlook driven by new program ramp-ups, higher content per vehicle, improving margins from operating leverage, and a turnaround in Europe. Growth in non-automotive segments such as consumer electronics and aerospace, along with a stable $87.2 billion order book, underpins the positive view. Automotive Axles features on YES Securities’ top picks list with a target price of Rs 2,410, indicating a potential upside of 26%. The brokerage cites structural shifts toward higher-tonnage vehicles, margin-accretive direct OEM sales starting from April 2025, and an improving business mix as key drivers. Strong entry barriers, new product ramp-ups, and recovery in MHCV volumes are expected to support earnings growth over FY25–27E. YES Securities has assigned a Buy rating on Rolex Rings with a target price of Rs 150, implying a 20% upside. The brokerage notes resilient profitability, mid-20% EBITDA margins, and one of the strongest balance sheets in the auto component space despite demand moderation in Western markets. Product diversification, early signs of order recovery, and potential resolution of the Right of Recompense overhang support the investment case. Motilal Oswal Financial Services is valued at a target price of Rs 997 by YES Securities, offering a 21% upside. The brokerage highlights improving earnings quality with a rising share of annuity and f",2026-01-22,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/5-stocks-yes-securities-expects-to-shine-in-2026-with-upsides-up-to-26/slideshow/126538367.cms,neutral,economictimes,,,,1

"Buy gold, sell Bitcoin: Jefferies' Chris Wood explains his big bet of 2026","Christopher Wood, the prominent global strategist at Jefferies, is liquidatingBitcoinholdings and reallocating capital back to physical gold. The quantum computing threat to Bitcoin's cryptographic foundations has prompted Wood to overhaul his asset allocation strategy, signaling that digital currencies may not prove to be the stable stores of value their proponents long claimed them to be.The catalyst for this dramatic reversal is not market performance, but rather an emerging existential risk to the Bitcoin system itself. Research from Chaincode Labs, cited prominently in Wood's analysis, estimates that between 20 and 50 percent of all bitcoins currently in circulation, totaling between 4 and 10 million BTC, could become vulnerable to theft once cryptographically relevant quantum computers (CRQCs) become a reality.While quantum computing threats have long been discussed in theoretical circles, the acceleration of development timelines has shifted the conversation from speculation to preparation.""While GREED & fear does not believe that the quantum issue is about to hit the Bitcoin price dramatically in the near term, the store of value concept is clearly on less solid foundation from the standpoint of a long-term pension portfolio. For that reason, GREED & fear will remove the 10% allocation to Bitcoin this week with 5% reallocated to gold and 5% reallocated to gold-mining stocks,"" Wood wrote in his weekly newsletter.Bitcoin was added to his portfolio with an initial 5% allocation on 17 December 2020 at a price of $22,779 with another 5% allocation added on 4 November 2021 with a price of $61,365.Live EventsDespite gold’s recent outperformance over Bitcoin, Bitcoin has still outperformed since the initial allocation, he said, adding that Bitcoin has risen by 325% since 17 December 2020 while gold bullion is up 145% over the same period.""The existential issue raised by quantum as regards Bitcoin can only be long-term positive for gold since it remains the historica",2026-01-22,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/buy-gold-sell-bitcoin-jefferies-chris-wood-explains-his-big-bet-of-2026/articleshow/126562462.cms,neutral,economictimes,,,,1

"Sensex slips over 100 pts, Nifty below 26,200 as geopolitics weigh on earnings optimism","Indian equities opened lower on Wednesday, with geopolitical tensions and tariff-related concerns blunting optimism around the earnings outlook and keeping the Sensex andNiftyjust shy of record territory.TheBSESensex fell 112 points, or 0.13%, at the open to 84,952, while theNSENifty 50 declined 56 points, or 0.22%, to begin the session at 26,122.On the 30-stock Sensex, losses were led byTata Motors Passenger Vehicles,HDFC Bank,Bharti Airtel,Bajaj FinservandBajaj Finance, with each stock sliding between 1% and 1.5%.In contrast, the broader market showed resilience, with midcap and smallcap indices advancing 0.3% and 0.2%, respectively.Among individual movers,Titanclimbed about 4% to a 52-week high after the Tata Group retailer posted a strong showing across its consumer businesses in the December quarter.Godrej Consumer Productsrose 2% after the company signalled solid operational performance for the period.Live EventsExpert viewsThe recent market movements have been devoid of any trend and clear direction and actions in a few mega stocks are influencing the overall market disproportionately, said Dr. VK Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist at Geojit Investments, adding that ""For instance, yesterday despite positive institutional buying Nifty drifted down by 71 points, mainly due to sharp declines in two stocks-Relianceand HDFC Bank. The large volumes in these two stocks in the derivative and cash market indicate activity associated with settlement day. In other words, the sharp dips in these stocks have nothing to do with their fundamentals; it is more technical in nature.""Going forward, there is scope for high volatility caused by events and news, said Vijayakumar, adding that ""Trump tweets and actions can always influence the market. Another important event which investors should closely watch is a possible Supreme Court verdict on Trump tariffs very soon. If the verdict goes against the reciprocal tariffs it will create huge volatility in stock markets.""FII/",2026-01-22,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/sensex-slips-over-100-pts-nifty-below-26200-as-geopolitics-weigh-on-earnings-optimism/articleshow/126386241.cms,neutral,economictimes,,,,1

Wipro sinks over 8% as weak Q4 guidance spooks investors,"Mumbai:Wipro sharesdropped more than 8% Monday, reacting to the disappointing outlook given by the country's fourth-biggest outsourcing company that announced itsearningsFriday.Analysts said disappointment over fourth-quartergrowthguidance by the management has led to the fall. They remain divided about the stock's prospects.Shares ofWiproended at ₹245.5 on NSE Monday, down 8.2%.Wipro ADRswere, however, up 2.18% on Monday 22.33 IST.Wipro'srevenue from operationswas at ₹23,556 crore for the quarter ended December 31, with sequential and on-year increases of 3.8% and 5.5%, respectively.Live Events“While performance was broadly in line with expectations, with stable growth and margins, the fourth quarter revenue guidance of 0-2% growth, including the impact of the Harman acquisition, came in below market expectations, likely contributing to the sharp correction in the stock price,” said Sushovon Nayak, research analyst, Anand Rathi Institutional Equities. Nayak said although the third quarter is typically seasonally weak, the softer Q4 outlook was unexpected by the Street.AgenciesAnalysts Divided over Stock Prospects“Delays in large deal ramp-ups and a 5% quarterly decline in the manufacturing vertical have further weighed on sentiment,” he said.The brokerage has downgraded Wipro from ‘Buy’ to ‘Hold’ and reduced its target price to Rs 300 against Rs 311 earlier, implying 22% upside from Friday’s close. Elara Capital reiterated a ‘Sell’ rating on the stock with a higher target price of Rs 220, due to Wipro’s lack of growth compared to peers , and downward pressure on margin.Elara’s note said the margin gap is likely to widen compared to large caps.JM Financialhas maintained its ‘Buy’ rating. “We cut EPS by 3-4.5% but maintain our target price; potential for a large capital return (buyback), undemanding valuations (19x FY27E), and expectations of an overall demand recovery keep us constructive,” said the brokerage’s note.Addas a Reliable and Trusted News SourceAdd Now!(Y",2026-01-22,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/wipro-sinks-over-8-as-weak-q4-guidance-spooks-investors/articleshow/126736077.cms,neutral,economictimes,,,,1

Risk-off sentiment in equities further boosted the allure of gold and silver, which extended their record-breaking rally on Tuesday, hitting new peaks.The NSE Nifty fell 353 points, or 1.4%, to close at 25,232.5, ending at its lowest since October 13.

With shareholding disclosures still being released, further portfolio changes cannot be ruled out.The market veteran has marginally reduced his stake in Monolithisch by 0.2% to 2.76%, data from the National Stock Exchange showed. He also appears to have exited Stanley Lifestyles, either through a complete sale or by bringing his holding below the 1% disclosure threshold. Agrawal is the founder of Param Capital Group and has over two decades of experience in the capital markets.One of the new additions isHindustan Construction Company, where Agrawal acquired a 1.68% stake, amounting to 4.40 crore shares, according to shareholding pattern data from the BSE.

"Kotak Bank, Trent among 5 Nifty stocks with highest EPS upgrades in December","The last year has been a mixed phase for the equity markets. Between December 2024 and December 2025, the Nifty delivered returns of 8.3%, even as earnings expectations weakened. FY26E and FY27E EPS estimates were cut by 7.8% and 6.5% over the past 12 months. However, December 2025 marked a small but important shift. EPS estimates for FY26E and FY27E rose 0.3% and 0.5% month-on-month, suggesting early signs of stabilisation. Against this backdrop, a handful of stocks stood out with clear upgrades. Source: JM Financial Kotak Mahindra Bank saw the highest EPS upgrade in December 2025, with estimates raised by 2.2%. The upgrade reflects improving confidence in asset quality, stable margins and the bank’s relatively conservative balance sheet. ICICI Bank recorded a 1.5% upgrade in EPS estimates during the month. Strong loan growth, controlled credit costs and steady improvement in return ratios have kept analysts positive. The bank continues to benefit from operating leverage and scale, even as system-wide growth moderates. Bharat Electronics saw EPS upgrades of 1.2% in December. The improvement is driven by strong execution of defence orders, healthy order inflows and sustained margin performance. Analysts are increasingly factoring in long-term visibility from government-led defence spending. Trent reported a 1.0% EPS upgrade for the month. Despite concerns around near-term margins, analysts remain encouraged by store expansion, Zudio’s scale-up and steady consumption trends. The upgrade suggests confidence that growth momentum can offset execution risks. Grasim saw a 0.7% EPS upgrade in December. The revision reflects a stabilising outlook across its cement, chemicals and new-age businesses. While the upgrade is modest, it signals improving confidence after a phase of earnings downgrades. In a month where earnings cuts still outnumbered upgrades, these five stocks stood out for attracting incremental optimism from analysts. The upgrades suggest that selective earning",2026-01-22,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/kotak-bank-trent-among-5-nifty-stocks-with-highest-eps-upgrades-in-december/slideshow/126365671.cms,neutral,economictimes,,,,1

"Silver smashes through Rs 3 lakh, ETFs jump 30% this year. Should you sell or wait for bigger target price?","Silverfutures onMCXtore through the Rs 3 lakh per kilogram barrier on Monday, surging over 5% asUS President Donald Trump's audacious bid to acquire Greenland and threats of punishing tariffs on Europe triggered a flight to precious metals, capping a ferocious 30% rally in the new year 2026 so far.The white metal's ascent to $93 per ounce, ""a level once considered unthinkable,"" according to Aamir Makda, Commodity & Currency Analyst at Choice Broking, has left silver ETFs up 30% year-to-date, building on last year's explosive momentum. Gold futures climbed 1.75% to Rs 1,45,000 per 10 grams, marking fresh all-time highs for both metals.""Gold and silver are no longer just commodities, they are geopolitics in metal form,"" said Amit Jain, Co-Founder of Ashika Global Family Office Services. ""When major powers fight over resources like Greenland, markets instinctively price in risk, and precious metals become the default refuge. This rally reflects not speculation, but a deeper loss of confidence in global stability.""Trump's latest salvo, a 10% tariff hike on European countries that could balloon to 25% by June, has turbocharged an already red-hot market driven by what Makda calls a ""perfect storm"" of industrial scarcity and geopolitical chaos.Over the past year, silver has skyrocketed more than 170%, while gold has gained over 70%. But the rally may be running on fumes.Live EventsMakda warned that technical charts are flashing warning signs even as prices hit new peaks. ""We have observed a RSI bearish divergence on the daily charts, which is a classic 'Red flag' warning. It suggests that while the price is still climbing and hitting new peaks, the internal momentum driving those gains is actually weakening,"" he said, adding that falling open interest levels point to ""long unwinding"" in March contracts. ""Traders who already have long positions should look for a profit-booking at current levels.""The metal's fundamental drivers remain powerful.

"Asian stocks dip, gold hits record as tariff woes return","Risk assets slipped and haven demand strengthened after US President Donald Trump proposed new levies on eight European countries, reviving tariff-related worries across markets. The dollar fell.US equity-index futures slumped as trading started on Monday, with contracts for the Nasdaq 100 retreating as much as 1%. Gold hit a record of over $4,680 an ounce and silver surged around 4% to an all-time high. Brent crude declined almost 1%. Treasury futures gained, while the dollar weakened against all its Group-of-10 peers, losing the most against the Swiss Franc and the Japanese yen.Stocks in Australia and Japan fell with cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin, also declining.The return oftariff concernscomes as risk appetite has been underpinned by strong earnings and heavy investment linked to artificial intelligence. That presents a fresh test for stock markets, which have climbed to record highs on the AI-led rally after rebounding from the selloff triggered by Trump’s century-high levies.“The immediate market reaction is likely to be a classic uncertainty shock,” said Shoki Omori, chief desk strategist at Mizuho Securities Co. in Tokyo. “It’s a clear signal that tariffs are being redefined as a geopolitical weapon rather than an economic negotiating tool. The point is not the initial 10%. The point is that nothing is ring-fenced anymore.”Live EventsTrump said over the weekend he’d impose a 10% tariff on goods from eight European countries starting Feb. 1, rising to 25% in June unless there’s a deal for a “purchase of Greenland.”The move drew quick rebukes from European leaders, who are now poised to halt the approval of the trade agreement struck last year. Bloomberg reported that French President Emmanuel Macron may request the activation of the EU’s anti-coercion instrument - the bloc’s most powerful retaliation tool.“The outcome of these new trade tensions is unclear, but what has long been evident is that there is no such thing as trade or tariff certainty anymore,",2026-01-22,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/asian-stocks-dip-gold-hits-record-as-tariff-woes-return/articleshow/126665337.cms,neutral,economictimes,,,,1

Thangamayil Jewellery shares jump 28% in just 3 sessions. What’s behind the sharp surge?,"Shares of Tamil Nadu–basedThangamayil Jewelleryrose as much as 8% to an intraday high of Rs 4,138 on Thursday, January 8, extending their rally to a third consecutive session. The stock has gained nearly 30% over the same period, reflecting sustained buying interest.The sharp gains appear to be driven by optimism stemming from strong Q3 business updates reported by peers, raising expectations of a similar performance by Thangamayil. For instance,TitanCompany’s overall consumer businesses posted around 40% year-on-year (YoY) growth, driven by strong festive demand and continued premiumisation trends.Titan’s jewellery division delivered a standout performance, recording approximately 41% YoY growth in Q3 FY26, supported by vibrant festive and wedding demand. Higher average selling prices, aided by elevated gold prices, compensated for largely flat buyer growth. Tanishq’s gold exchange offers helped sustain demand beyond the festive season. Gold coin saleSenco Gold’s sales and revenue increased 51% in the third quarter from the previous year, in the backdrop of 6.5% and 28% growth in the previous two quarters, respectively. In the first nine months of FY26, the same metric grew by 31% from the same period last year, the company said in a regulatory filing on January 6.Senco’s trailing twelve month revenue has already reached Rs 8000 crore, reflecting consistent on-year growth, loyal customer base and brand positioning.

"Indian top IT firms set for another tepid quarter on weak US demand, client spending","India's information technology firms are expected to report another muted quarter, ‍as tepid demand in the U.S. and ​holiday-period client shutdowns continue to weigh on tech spending, nine brokerages said ahead of ⁠earnings.Brokerages expect the top six IT firms by revenue to post about 4% year-on-year revenue growth and a 5% rise in profit for the December quarter on average, reflecting prolonged demand softness, compared with 6.5% revenue growth in the September quarter.Indian software exporters last ‌reported double-digit revenue ‌growth in the March quarter of 2023, when digital transformation, cloud adoption and remote-work demand surged in the post-pandemic period.The broader $283 billion Indian IT industry ‌continues to face macro headwinds, including uncertainty over U.S. tariffs, challenges from proposed $100,000 visa fees, and subdued client spending on concerns about growth in the world's largest economy.India's IT companies earn a significant share of their revenue from the United States, making the world's largest economy crucial for the sector.Live EventsSector bellwether Accenture's recent earnings beat Wall Street expectations ​on AI-led demand, though its unchanged growth outlook underscores the cautious near-term ​environment.Although India has no pure-play AI firms, IT companies are beginning to shape AI strategies through ‌acquisitions and partnerships. ‍Brokerages expect AI momentum to build over the next six months and demand to ‍pick up into 2026.""Clients remain cautious about committing incremental spending to large ‌programs amid macro and tariff uncertainty and a new tech cycle,"" said Abhishek Pathak, research analyst at Motilal Oswal Financial Services.U.S. tariff uncertainty, visa worries and weak spending drove record foreign outflows of $8.5 billion from IT stocks in 2025, nearly half of total foreign exits from Indian equities.The Nifty IT index fell 12.6% in 2025, making it the worst-performing sector as Indian markets lagged Asian a",2026-01-22,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/indian-top-it-firms-set-for-another-tepid-quarter-on-weak-us-demand-client-spending/articleshow/126407753.cms,neutral,economictimes,,,,1

"Nomura picks Infosys as top IT bet, sees FY26 guidance hike positive despite Q3 PAT decline","Global brokerage firmNomurahas reiterated its bullish stance onInfosys, maintaining a ‘Buy’ rating on the stock with a target price of Rs 1,810, continuing to rank the stock as its top pick in the large-cap Indian IT services space, despite the IT major reporting a year-on-year decline in its consolidated net profit for the December quarter.Infosys posted a 2% YoY dip in its Q3FY26 net profit at Rs 6,654 crore, compared with Rs 6,806 crore in the same quarter last year. However, revenue from operations rose 9% YoY to Rs 45,479 crore. In dollar terms, the company reported revenue of USD 5,099 million, marking a 0.6% sequential increase and a 1.7% rise in constant currency terms, slightly ahead of consensus estimates.According to Nomura, Infosys delivered a revenue beat in Q3FY26, although it witnessed a modest miss on margins. The adjusted EBIT margin stood at 21.2%, up 20 basis points quarter-on-quarter, but 10 bps below consensus.Margins benefited from tailwinds, including improved realisations from Project Maximus and favourable currency movements, although these were offset by furloughs and increased variable payouts. Nomura expects EBIT margins to remain stable at around 21% for the full year FY26, within the guided band of 20–22%.A key highlight for the quarter was Infosys raising its revenue growth guidance for FY26 from the earlier 2–3% range to 3–3.5% in constant currency terms.Live EventsNomura highlighted that this revised guidance assumes varying macro scenarios, with the lower end reflecting continued uncertainty and the upper end factoring in some macro recovery.The large deal total contract value for the quarter stood at USD 4.85 billion, marking a 94% YoY jump, with net new wins comprising 57% of that figure.Infosys expects revenue growth acceleration in verticals such as BFSI and Energy, Utilities, Resources and Services (EURS), particularly by FY27E.

Thangamayil Jewellery among 5 stocks witnessing 5-year swing high breakouts,"In the NSE list of stocks with a market capitalisation of over Rs 1,000 crore, five stocks recorded a 5-year swing high at the close on January 8, indicating bullish momentum in these counters, according to StockEdge’s technical scan data.A 5-year swing high refers to the highest price a stock has achieved over the past five years. This level typically acts as a significant resistance zone where prices have historically struggled to move higher. Hitting this level may be viewed as a bullish signal, suggesting the potential for further upside. However, this is distinct from a 5-year breakout, which occurs when a stock decisively surpasses a resistance level that has remained intact for five years or more.

"Meesho’s 129% post-IPO rally fizzles as stock slides 35% from peak amid valuation concerns. Buy, sell or hold?","Meesho’s seven-session multibagger rally, which saw the stock surge 129% over its IPO price, has hit a speed bump, with shares slipping 35% from the peak amid valuation concerns, the expiry of the anchor lock-in period, and a senior management reshuffle. Adding to the pressure, cautious commentary from brokerages and analysts is capping any runaway upside in an otherwise weak market environment.Listed on December 10 at a premium of 46%, Meesho's significant rally led its share price to soar to Rs 254.40, and it has been on a downward trend since then. The stock fell to its low of Rs 153.89 and is now in recovery mode.Abhinav Tiwari, Research Analyst at Bonanza, attributes the ongoing pressure on Meesho to the IPO lock-in expiry, which has increased the supply of shares in the market and led to selling by early investors and pre-IPO shareholders. In addition, the stock had been trading at elevated valuation multiples compared to other consumer internet and retail peers, prompting profit-taking.""This lock-in related supply, combined with broader risk-off sentiment toward high valuation new age stocks, has resulted in valuation de-rating, even as the underlying business performance remains largely intact,"" Tiwari said.According to market data, up to 110 million shares, or about 2% of the company’s outstanding equity, have become tradeable.Live EventsIn a recently released note,JM Financialsaid that the stock price has run up sharply, leaving minimal room for error despite the differentiated business model and the company remaining a key player in the Indian e-commerce space.JM Financial's stock valuation based on the discounted cash flows (DCF) yields an equity value of Rs 170 per share, implying a 108x/25x FY28/FY30 EV/adjusted EBITDA multiple.Also Read:After blockbuster 2025, metal stocks tumble up to 10% weekly this year.

NSE shares surge after IPO clouds seem to clear,"Mumbai: Shares of National Stock Exchange (NSE) once again climbed above the ₹2,000 mark, surging 6% in unlisted trading on Monday, after the Securities and Exchange Board of India chief's comments over the weekend that the bourse's much-awaited initial public offer will be cleared, possibly in January, rekindled investor interest. The stock ended at ₹2,095 on Monday, according to data from unlistedzone.com. On Friday, they had closed at ₹1,975.Sebi chairperson Tuhin Kanta Pandey said on Saturday said the regulator is at a ""very advanced stage"" of granting the no-objection certificate (NoC) for NSE's IPO, according to ANI.""There has been a pick-up in incremental demand and higher trading volumes in NSE shares over the weekend,"" said Sandip Ginodia, director at Altius Investech, which deals in unlisted shares.NSE shares have been under pressure of late and have mostly stayed below ₹2,000 since September on account of the delay in IPO approval and pressures on profits following Sebi's clampdown on the equity derivatives market. ""NSE shares had rallied to around ₹2,400 last year before correcting to nearly ₹1,800 following the announcement of Q2 results and increasing derivative curbs from the regulator, increasing minimum contract size,"" said Hitesh Dharawat, who owns Dharawat Securities.In the September quarter, NSE's consolidated profit after tax went down 33% and consolidated revenue from operations decreased by 18% from the same period a year ago. Dharawat said the latest upswing could be short-lived.Live Events""With expectations of dull Q3, we believe the current price levels may not be sustainable,"" he said. ""The fair value of the shares lies in the ₹1,500-₹1,800 range, due to the recent limited growth in the capital markets segment and heightened hype or frenzy around the stock.""After Sebi banned multiple weekly derivatives contracts from exchanges in November 2024, trading volumes as well as revenues have taken a hit at the exchange level. Ginodia is optimisti",2026-01-22,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/nse-shares-surge-after-ipo-clouds-seem-to-clear/articleshow/126494736.cms,neutral,economictimes,,,,1

Top NBFCs seek RBI nod to raise retail deposits,"MUMBAI: Large non-banking finance companies (NBFCs) have urged the central bank to allow them to raise deposits from retail investors-a move they say would create a level playing field among finance companies and improve transmission of policy rates, people familiar with the matter told ET.This request was conveyed by select finance companies to the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) governorSanjay Malhotra, during a closed-door meeting held on Monday.Except for a few NBFCs with legacy licences, most NBFCs are barred from raising retail deposits.Bajaj Finance,Shriram Finance, and Mahindra Finance are among the few NBFCs that are permitted to accept retail deposits. The governor met the CEOs of NBFCs, housing finance companies, microfinance institutions, and industry representatives on Monday.To be sure, the RBI has long resisted demands from well-rated NBFCs to be allowed to garner retail deposits, something that is the funding mainstay for banks.Live Events""The critical issue here is that bank deposits, up to Rs 5 lakh, are insured by DICGC or Deposit Insurance and Credit Guarantee Corporation, unlike NBFC deposits. That is one of the concerns preventing the regulator from issuing new deposit-taking licences to finance companies,"" said an economist, who declined to be named. ""The regulator would always err on the side of caution.""NBFCs that are allowed to raise deposits face strict limits. Retail deposits can't exceed 1.5 times their net owned funds. The term deposits must have tenures ranging from 12 to 60 months, and interest rates are capped at 12.5% per annum.As of March 2025, retail deposits accounted for about 12.5% of resources deposits raised by NBFCs-D, the RBI said in its annual Trend and Progress report. The report noted that five major NBFC-Ds account for 96.9% of aggregate deposits.Speaking to ET, Jairam Sridharan, MD ofPiramal Finance, hinted that while NBFCs seek a stable liability structure, few aspire for a banking licence that would allow retail deposit",2026-01-22,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/top-nbfcs-seek-rbi-nod-to-raise-retail-deposits/articleshow/126384420.cms,neutral,economictimes,,,,1

We are in a highly uncertain phase, Vijayakumar said, adding that ""Therefore, investors can also think of increasing the cash position in their portfolios even while remaining invested. Heightened uncertainty triggered by unprecedented geopolitical events demands a cautious approach to investment supported by higher cash position to exploit sudden movements in the market.""The banking sector is moving to a stronger position supported by increasing cr",2026-01-22,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/sensex-falls-over-300-pts-nifty-below-26200-as-d-st-hovers-near-record-highs/articleshow/126365124.cms,neutral,economictimes,,,,1

NALCO shares scale fresh record high after 14% jump in 4 days. Can the aluminium-backed momentum last?,"Shares ofNational Aluminium Company Ltd(NALCO) surged to a fresh 52-week high on Wednesday, extending a sharp four-day rally that has added 14% to the stock, as a spike in globalaluminium pricesand improving industry fundamentals lifted investor sentiment.NALCO sharesclimbed as much as 3% to Rs 357.50 on the BSE on Wednesday, taking their recent gains to 14% in just four sessions. The move comes against the backdrop of aluminium prices hitting their highest level in more than three years, withLondon Metal Exchangeprices breaching the $3,000-per-tonne mark to trade at $3,082.Global prices provide the sparkThe rally in aluminium has been driven by tight supply conditions, as a cap on smelting capacity in China and production constraints in Europe due to elevated electricity costs have weighed on global inventories. At the same time, demand prospects remain strong, supported by sustained requirements from the construction and renewable energy sectors, Bloomberg said in a note.The improving global outlook has reinforced expectations of a tighter market ahead. Last month, CNBC TV-18 reported that Brijendra Pratak Singh, managing director of NALCO, said the global aluminium market is expected to move into a supply deficit in 2026 and 2027 as demand continues to rise across multiple sectors. “The demands are increasing from the EV sector, construction sector, power sector, and now huge data centres are coming,” Singh said.Live EventsNALCO Q2 resultsThe recent surge also builds on a solid set of earnings. Nalco’s September-quarter net profit climbed 36.7% year-on-year to Rs 1,430 crore, up from Rs 1,046 crore a year earlier, aided by higher realisations and improved operating efficiency. Revenue rose 31.5% to Rs 4,292 crore from Rs 4,001 crore in the year-ago period.Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation increased 24.8% to Rs 1,932.9 crore, while operating margins expanded to 45% from 38.7%, reflecting stronger pricing power and cost discipline.In a no",2026-01-22,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/nalco-shares-scale-fresh-record-high-after-14-jump-in-4-days-can-the-aluminium-backed-momentum-last/articleshow/126388433.cms,neutral,economictimes,,,,1

Gainers & Losers: Wipro and Waaree among 6 stocks that were major movers on Monday,"Jan 5, 2026 Shares of Gandhar Oil Refinery (India) soared 17% to hit an intraday high of Rs 177.79 on the NSE on Monday, driven by heavy trade volumes and potentially due to rising geopolitical tensions involving the US and Venezuela, a country with significant oil reserves. The stock ended at Rs 167.58, up 10.42% from its previous close. Image Source: ETMarkets.com Shares of Ola Electric Mobility ended the day with nearly 8% gains at Rs 44.01 on the NSE, extending a blistering 16% rally in early 2026 as investors seized on signs of a business turnaround driven by improved service execution, strength in demand, and rising market share in India’s electric two-wheeler market. Image Source: ETMarkets.com Shares of Hindustan Copper surged over 5% on Monday to hit a fresh 52-week high of Rs 570 on the NSE, though it gave up some gains to settle 2% higher at Rs 552.80 amid weakness in the overall market. Image Source: ETMarkets.com Shares of Bajaj Finance ended 1.3% lower at Rs 977.65 on the NSE amid weakness in financial stocks. India's largest NBFC reported a 15% YoY jump in new loans booked in Q3FY26 to 1.39 crore versus 1.21 crore in the year-ago period. The company's AUM grew by 22% or Rs 23,600 crore to approximately Rs 4,85,900 crore in the quarter under review versus Rs 3,98,043 crore as of 31 December 2024. Image Source: ETMarkets.com Wipro shares settled 2.2% lower at Rs 263 on the NSE, turning out to be the worst major IT performer as IT stocks fell up to 3.7% intraday ahead of the earnings season. Infosys and HCL Technologies also declined, over 2% each. US President Donald Trump's fresh tariff threat to India and adverse sectoral views by Citi and CLSA also dented sentiment. Image Source: ETMarkets.com Shares of Waaree Energies closed 5.3% lower at Rs 2,713.10 on the NSE. While the reason for its fall was not known, its performance has remained subdued despite the recent inclusion in the F&O list.

IEX shares zoom 14% on hopes of relief in market coupling case,"Shares ofIndian Energy Exchange(IEX) soared as much as 14% to an intraday high of Rs 153.35 on the BSE on Tuesday, January 6, on hopes of relief in the market coupling case being heard by the Electricity Appellate Tribunal (APTEL).The tribunal, hearing the contentiousmarket coupling regulationsproposed by the Central Electricity Regulatory Commission (CERC), raised multiple concerns during the hearing, questioning how the market coupling rules were formulated. APTEL remarked that CERC should have acted independently while drafting the framework.It also pointed to excessive theatrics observed in the formulation process and emphasized the need for CERC to maintain independence and remain above suspicion.According to CNBC TV-18, the sharp upward move in IEX shares followed developments in the ongoing legal proceedings. APTEL has set January 9 as the next date for the hearing after counsel sought additional time.Reports also suggest that the tribunal informed CERC that if it signals a potential withdrawal of the order, the case would be closed by Friday.Live EventsOn Monday, the power exchange also shared its third quarter business updates for FY26. Indian Energy Exchange, the country’s leading electricity trading platform, recorded an electricity traded volume of 34.08 billion units (excluding TRAS) in the third quarter of FY26, reflecting a year-on-year growth of 11.9%.In the third quarter of the current financial year, improved supply from hydro and wind sources, along with steady coal-based generation, enhanced supply liquidity on the exchange platform. This contributed to a significant reduction in prices across key market segments.The Market Clearing Price in the Day-Ahead Market stood at Rs 3.22 per unit in Q3 FY26, registering a 13.2% decline from the same quarter last year. Likewise, the Real-Time Market Clearing Price dropped to Rs 3.26 per unit, down 11.6% year-on-year.IEX ended Tuesday’s session at Rs 146.80 on the BSE, higher by 9.3%.Also read:Rs 1 lakh cro",2026-01-22,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/iex-shares-zoom-14-on-hopes-of-relief-in-market-coupling-case/articleshow/126372019.cms,neutral,economictimes,,,,1

Waaree Energies shares slip 15% in 9 days. What's behind the slide?,"Waaree Energiesshares slid as much as 2.7% on Tuesday, extending a relentless selloff to a ninth straight session and dragging the stock down nearly 15% in just over a week, as weak technical signals continued to weigh oninvestor sentimentdespite a recent capital raise at its energy storage arm.The stock fell to as low as Rs 2,642 on the BSE on January 6, taking its cumulative decline over the past nine trading sessions to 14.6%. The sustained slide has come even as the company disclosed a Rs 1,003-crore fundraise to support an ambitious expansion plan in advancedbattery manufacturing.9-day slide, bearish charts dominateFrom a technical standpoint, Waaree Energies is flashing strong bearish signals. The stock is currently trading below all eight of its key simple moving averages, including the 5-day, 10-day, 20-day, 30-day, 50-day, 100-day, 150-day and 200-day SMAs, pointing to persistent weakness across short-, medium- and long-term charts.Momentum indicators also remain under pressure. The Relative Strength Index stands at 27.1, below the 30 mark that is widely seen as oversold, a level that can sometimes signal the potential for a rebound. At the same time, the Moving Average Convergence Divergence is at -70.6 and remains below both its centre and signal lines, reinforcing a strong bearish indicator.Live EventsFundraise announced amid selloffThe decline has unfolded even as the company informed exchanges on January 5 that its subsidiary, Waaree Energy Storage Solutions, raised Rs 1,003 crore from strategic investors, including high-net-worth individuals, family offices and institutional backers.The fundraise forms part of Waaree’s broader Rs 10,000-crore capital expenditure plan to set up a 20 GWh advanced lithium-ion cell and battery pack manufacturing facility, the company said in a statement.

"YES Bank Q3 Results Preview: Profit likely to jump 27% YoY, NII seen rising up to 12%; here’s what else to expect","YES Bank is scheduled to announce its December-quarter results on Saturday (January 17) with brokerages anticipating a mixed performance. Analysts expect a patchy recovery, steady but muted growth in core income, largely stable margins, and a broad range of profit estimates. While investors continue to favour peers such as HDFC Bank, ICICI Bank, Axis Bank, Kotak Mahindra Bank, and select public sector lenders, expectations from YES Bank remain cautious. Brokerages are divided — some foresee a modest earnings improvement, while others expect a stronger year-on-year jump driven by a lower base effect.The private lender is expected to deliver high single-digit to low double-digit growth in net interest income (NII) in Q3FY26, with estimates clustering between 9% and nearly 12% YoY. Net profit (PAT) forecasts, however, span a much wider band—from low single-digit growth to as much as 27% YoY, reflecting divergent assumptions on credit costs, operating leverage, and the pace of balance-sheet repair. Loan growth is seen in the mid-single digits YoY, deposits growing at a similar or slightly higher pace, and net interest margins (NIMs) broadly stable with mild volatility.YES Bank will declare its financial results for the quarter and nine months ended December 31, 2025, and subsequently hold a post-earnings conference call with analysts and investors at 2:45 pm on the same day.The broad picture: steady NII, uneven profit recoveryAcross brokerages, the consensus view is that YES Bank’s operating performance continues to improve incrementally but lags sector leaders. NII growth is expected to remain resilient despite pressure on loan yields and a competitive deposit environment, aided by balance-sheet stability and controlled funding costs. NIMs are largely seen as flat to marginally higher or lower on a sequential basis, depending on assumptions around rate cuts, CRR-related benefits, and deposit repricing.Live EventsProfitability remains the swing factor.

"HDFC Bank’s forced balancing act drags stock, makes it Nifty Bank’s biggest laggard. What to do?","HDFC Bankshares continue to underperform despite largely in-line Q3 earnings and positive commentary from leading brokerages. India’s largest private lender has been the worst performer in the Nifty Bank index over the past six months, sliding 6%. While the broader outlook remains constructive, the bank finds itself in a delicate balancing act between loan growth and deposit mobilisation.HDFC Bank’s Q3FY26 earnings show steady undertones, with the lender’s profit after tax (PAT) ahead of Elara’s estimates, while the pre-provisioning operating profit (PPoP) was in line with the brokerage’s estimates.Axis Securities, in its Q3 review, also maintained a buoyant growth outlook for HDFC Bank following its in-line PAT and net interest income (NII), though PPoP was below its estimates.HDFC Bank on Saturday reported an 11% jump in its December quarter standalone net profit at Rs 18,654 crore compared to Rs 16,735 crore reported in the year-ago period. HDFC Bank’s net interest income (NII) for the quarter ended December 31, 2025, grew by 6.4% to Rs 32,620 crore from Rs 30,650 crore for the quarter ended December 31, 2024. Core net interest margin stood at 3.35% on total assets and 3.51% based on interest-earning assets.Read more:HDFC Bank Q3 Results: PAT jumps 11% YoY to Rs 18,654 crore, beats estimates; NII up 6.4%Live EventsWhat’s holding the stock?Amid concerns around deposits, HDFC Bank finds itself in a vicious web of balancing too many variables. “We have been arguing about its conundrum to manage growth vs NIM vs LCR vs CD (or LDR) ratio outcomes, which are likely to cause dislocation,” Elara said in a note.While 12% YoY loan growth in Q3FY26 reflects a trend reversal, FY25 tells the tale of sub-6% YoY loan growth in its bid to accelerate the CD ratio outcome, Elara said. Deposit growth of 11.6% YoY was lower in Q3FY26, with the ratio going up again. Elara expects it to remain stretched, despite the bank directionally maintaining guidance for a lower CD ratio.A high C",2026-01-22,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/hdfc-banks-forced-balancing-act-drags-stock-6-makes-it-nifty-banks-biggest-laggard-what-to-do/articleshow/126762903.cms,neutral,economictimes,,,,1

How 2026 is shaping up for Indian investors? Gurmeet Chadha shares his asset class view,"As the global macroeconomic landscape shifts, investors may be looking to rebalance portfolios for the year ahead. From equities to precious metals and bonds, the asset allocation strategy for 2026 is already taking shape.Gurmeet Chadha, Managing Partner and Chief Investment Officer at Complete Circle Consultants, has shared a snapshot of how different asset classes are expected to perform, based on recent interactions with senior portfolio managers, investors, and promoters.Chadha’s insights come at a time when multiple triggers, from domestic policy actions to global developments, are likely to influence market sentiment. His outlook provides a nuanced view on where opportunities and caution zones lie, helping investors align their strategies across Indian and global equities, bonds, and commodities.— connectgurmeet (@connectgurmeet)Indian equities: A constructive setupAccording to Chadha, Indian equities may be better positioned in 2026, especially following interest rate cuts and tax reforms. He notes that markets typically respond well to such structural moves, albeit with a lag.Live Events“Valuations have seen both price and time correction, making the setup for 2026 relatively constructive,” he said. Among the key triggers he identifies are the EU-India Free Trade Agreement, the Union Budget, and corporate earnings.Precious metals: Caution advised on silverChadha advises caution in the precious metals segment, particularly with silver. He suggests that investors maintain a balanced exposure, recommending a 5–10% allocation in gold and silver combined.“Be cautious, especially on silver. Don’t go overboard,” he remarked, pointing to the heightened volatility in the space.Global equities and AI trade: Moderation aheadOn the global equity front, Chadha expects a more tempered outlook in 2026. He believes the AI trade, which saw considerable momentum in recent months, may witness some profit-taking or moderation going forward.Bonds: Long duration may outperformCha",2026-01-22,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/how-2026-is-shaping-up-for-indian-investors-gurmeet-chadha-shares-his-asset-class-view/articleshow/126453344.cms,neutral,economictimes,,,,1
A case for rethinking Sebi’s new merchant banking rules,"In my article of September 17, 2024, “SEBI’s proposed merchant banking regulations, will it make the big, bigger?”, I dealt at length with the unintended and potentially adverse impact of the proposed changes. SEBI has now notified the amended Merchant Banking Regulations, followed by a detailed circular setting out how the new framework will be implemented from January 3, 2026.Taken together, these represent the most far-reaching rework of India’s merchant banking regulations since 1992. With the consultation process now concluded and the framework formally in place, the discussion inevitably shifts from regulatory intent to how these changes are likely to reshape the industry in practice. Even so, I make one more attempt to sincerely urge a re-review of these changes.Merchant banking regulations in India were framed in a very different market context. The merchant banker of the 1990s was closer to a balance-sheet underwriter, absorbing risk in relatively shallow capital markets. Today’s merchant banker, by contrast, operates more like a transaction architect, where judgement, execution capability and credibility matter far more than deployable capital.At present, 238 registered merchant bankers are operating in a far more institutionalised ecosystem. Their role has evolved towards advisory-led activities across the transaction lifecycle, spanning IPOs, pre-IPO and private capital raises, mergers and acquisitions, buybacks, delistings and other complex capital market transactions.While SEBI has attempted to introduce some flexibility compared to the original proposals, the broader concerns remain largely unaddressed. I am perplexed by the rationale for these changes, particularly at a time when the country is moving towards a low-touch regulatory regime. Further, there have been no major market disruptions, failures or systemic risks that would warrant such sweeping regulatory intervention.Live EventsApart from several operational challenges, two substantive issues",2026-01-22,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/a-case-for-rethinking-sebis-new-merchant-banking-rules/articleshow/126544189.cms,neutral,economictimes,,,,1

FII holding in Eternal declines for 7th straight quarter. Is recent correction a buying opportunity?,"Foreign institutional investor holding inEternalhas steadily declined over the past seven quarters, reflecting a combination of regulatory decisions and index-related flows in India’s new-age internet stock. Data from Trendlyne shows thatFIIownership has fallen from 54% in June 2024 to 36.2% by December 2025, marking a sharp and uninterrupted reduction in foreign shareholding.This seven-quarter slide coincides with a key strategic decision taken by Eternal’s board in April 2025, when it approved capping foreign ownership at 49.5% to maintain the company’s status as an Indian-Owned and Controlled Company under FEMA regulations. The move was aimed at ensuring regulatory flexibility for Eternal’s fast-growing quick commerce business, Blinkit.Under domestic FDI rules, e-commerce platforms with majority foreign ownership, defined as more than 50%, are not permitted to hold inventory and can only operate through the marketplace model. Retaining IOCC status allows Eternal to shift Blinkit to an inventory-led business model, under which the company can stock its own inventory rather than merely facilitating transactions between sellers and consumers.Operating an inventory-led model gives the company tighter control over product assortment, supply chains and pricing, while also enabling better margin management. Over time, this could translate into improved profitability, especially in a segment where speed, availability and unit economics play a critical role.However, the decision to cap foreign ownership mechanically reduces the room available for foreign investors, which partly explains the steady decline in FII holding over successive quarters.Live EventsRecent correction a buying window?While FII holding has been falling, recent brokerage commentary suggests that sentiment on Eternal’s stock may be stabilising after a sharp correction. Shares of Eternal, which operatesZomatoand Blinkit, have declined around 25% from its record high of Rs 368 it clinched in October 2025,",2026-01-22,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/fii-holding-in-eternal-declines-for-7th-straight-quarter-is-recent-correction-a-buying-opportunity/articleshow/126517735.cms,neutral,economictimes,,,,1

5 IPOs opening this week. GMPs suggest up to 70% listing gain,"The IPO market is off to a steady start in the new year with 5 IPOs opening this week. Early grey market signals suggest strong investor interest in select names, with indications of listing gains of up to 70% in one marquee issue. The Bharat Coking Coal IPO stands out as the most tracked issue of the week. Grey market premium for the stock is hovering around Rs 16–17, implying potential listing gains of over 70% against the issue price. The Coal India subsidiary has attracted attention due to its strategic importance and strong sector positioning. Among SME offerings, Gabion Technologies has generated strong early interest. The stock is commanding a grey market premium of around Rs 30, translating into a potential listing gain of about 37%. Victory Electric Vehicles opens this week on the SME platform with a fixed-price issue. While there is no active grey market premium yet, the issue is being watched closely due to its exposure to the electric mobility theme. Yajur Fibres, another SME issue opening this week. Though grey market activity is currently muted, investors tracking sustainability-linked businesses are keeping the issue on their radar. Defrail Technologies rounds out the week's IPO calendar. Grey market indicators are yet to reflect any premium, suggesting a more cautious approach from investors. The IPO calendar for the week may not be crowded, but select offerings -- especially Bharat Coking Coal and Gabion Technologies -- are drawing strong attention. Investor appetite remains stock-specific, with quality, visibility and valuation continuing to dictate subscription trends rather than sheer volume of issues.(Disclaimer: Recommendations, suggestions, views and opinions given by the experts are their own.

Nomura says United Spirits is at the cusp of a developing upcycle; initiates with Buy rating. 3 reasons why,"United Spirits, one of India’s leading alcoholic beverage makers, is at the cusp of a developing upcycle, says international brokerageNomuraafter it initiated coverage with a Buy rating on the counter.With a target price of Rs 1,650, the brokerage implies an upside potential of 23.5% from current market levels. The stock has had a rough start to the year, down 7% already in the first month. Here’s why analysts see a turnaround.Premiumisation tailwinds aheadShifting consumer demographics and preferences towards Prestige & Above (P&A) brands have strengthened United Spirits’ growth profile. Over FY22–25, the company delivered a robust 15% revenue CAGR while lifting the P&A share of its portfolio from 73% to 90% following the rationalisation of lower-end brands. With its portfolio now heavily skewed towards high-growth premium labels, USL is well placed to address gaps in the mid-segment, where its presence remains limited.Backed by Diageo’s parentage, strong brand equity and higher-than-peer marketing investments, the company has ample headroom to capture white spaces in its portfolio, upgrade consumers and drive margin expansion. EBITDA margins have already improved meaningfully, with further scope for gains.Live EventsRegulatory winds turningRecent regulatory easing across key states such as Andhra Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh and Karnataka, alongside the India–UK trade agreement and a steady cadence of innovation, are expected to support volume growth over the medium term. While sharp duty hikes in Maharashtra could trigger some near-term downtrading, the impact is likely to be offset by these broader tailwinds.Importantly, USL’s premium-heavy mix offers resilience against regulatory volatility, insulating the business from adverse shifts. Factoring in near-term pressures and medium-term benefits, the outlook remains constructive, with healthy growth anticipated in both sales and operating profit.Innovation-led expansionUnited Spirits has steadily reshaped its portfolio",2026-01-22,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/nomura-says-united-spirits-is-at-the-cusp-of-a-developing-upcycle-initiates-with-buy-rating-3-reasons-why/articleshow/126538479.cms,neutral,economictimes,,,,1

The decision forms part of Sebi’s revamped stock brokers’ regulations notified on Thursday, marking a comprehensive overhaul of norms that were more than 30 years old.""A stock broker may carry out an activity under the regulatory framework of the other financial sector regulator or any other specified authority in the manner as may be specified by the Board,"" the notification said.Stock brokers and clearing members will now be regulated by Sebi (Stock Brokers) Regulations 2026 (SB Regulation) which has now replaced Sebi's (Stock Brokers) Regulations 1992.The new rules encompass simplified regulatory language, remove outdated provisions, and introduce clearer definitions. The move is aimed at modernising the regulatory architecture in line with evolving market practices while making compliance simpler and more transparent for market intermediaries.Sebi approved the proposal to overhaul the regulatory framework governing stock brokers on December 17, clearing the way for the new rules.Live EventsThe SB Regulations have been structured into eleven chapters, comprehensively covering key aspects of the regulatory regime for stockbrokers.The regulations have been simplified and condensed, cutting pages from 59 to 24, and the word count has been reduced.The market regulator had earlier said the word count will reduce from 18,846 words to 9,073 words.As part of the revamp, Sebi deleted certain schedules that are no longer required and integrated relevant ones directly into the regulations as chapters to improve readability and understanding.For instance, historical and non-applicable provisions—such as those related to physical share delivery and Forward Market Commission sub-brokers—have been eliminated.Sebi clarificationsThe notificat",2026-01-22,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/sebi-revamps-stockbrokers-rule-to-ease-compliance-push-ease-of-doing-biz/articleshow/126414670.cms,neutral,economictimes,,,,1

"Will Budget revive capex stocks? What defence, rail and infra investors should watch","The upcoming UnionBudgeton February 1 is shaping up as a litmus test for the capex trade, which has lost momentum over the past year. After a sharp front-loading of government capital spending in the first half of FY26, execution has normalised, valuations have reset, and investors are now looking for policy signals that could extend, or decisively cap, the cycle.Dalal Street expectations suggest the government is likely to stick to fiscal discipline, leaving limited headroom for a broad-based capex push. With the fiscal deficit trajectory largely locked and tax collections under pressure, any incremental spending is expected to be selective rather than expansive. This shifts the focus from headline numbers to sectoral allocation and intent, with defence, railways, and a handful of infrastructure-linked segments likely to absorb a disproportionate share of attention.Defence appears best positioned, supported by emergency procurement in FY26, sustained indigenisation push and a likely step-up in allocations for allied industries. Railways, particularly safety, signalling and rolling stock, remain in favour, even as broader infra segments such as roads and housing risk seeing flatter allocations.Defence stands out as the clear winner. Emergency procurement added Rs 40,000 crore in FY26, and Motilal Oswal expects defence spending to jump 15% in FY27 from an estimated Rs 1.8 lakh crore base. Allied industries, shipbuilding, electronics, and critical minerals, are set to ride the indigenisation wave as the government doubles down on strategic resilience.Railways will hold ground, but only in pockets: Safety, signalling, and rolling stock remain priorities. The rest—roads, housing, and broader rail segments that made up 47% of FY26's capex allocation—face a subdued outlook. BofA Securities’s economists Rahul Bajoria and Smriti Mehra warn that “allocation could continue to remain subdued for Roads, Railways (remaining sub-segments) and Housing.”Live EventsCapex growth itse",2026-01-22,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/will-budget-revive-capex-stocks-what-defence-rail-and-infra-investors-should-watch/articleshow/126518763.cms,neutral,economictimes,,,,1
Ahead of Market: 10 things that will decide stock market action on Thursday,"The Indian market ended lower for a third consecutive session on Wednesday, deepening a sharp market rout that has erased nearly Rs 14 lakh crore in investor wealth. The selloff, driven by global jitters and uneven corporate earnings, pushed the benchmark Sensex down more than 1,660 points over three sessions, while the Nifty 50 slipped about 2%.At the end of the session, the BSE Sensex had trimmed losses to end down 271 points, or 0.33%, at 81,909.63. The Nifty 50 fell 75 points, or 0.30%, to settle at 25,157.50.Here's how analysts read the market pulse:Domestic markets were gripped by volatility asglobal risk factorsdampened sentiment, said Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Investments, adding that value buying towards the close helped the market recover some early losses.“In this challenging environment, tepid earnings from the banking and IT sectors are adding to the overall pressure on equities. The weakening INR and uncertainties surrounding trade ties may prolong this volatility. Nevertheless, the ongoing earnings season could present selective accumulation opportunities as the next session is expected to be better-off led by the resilient domestic demand,"" said Nair.Also read |5 Wall Street moguls who dismissed Bitcoin as a fad — Guess what they’re saying now!Live EventsUS marketsUS stocks mostly steadied Wednesday as US President Donald Trump doubled down on his demands for ""immediate negotiations"" to take control of Greenland in a much-anticipated speech at Davos, though he did say he would not use force.Markets had tumbled earlier this week after Trump threatened tariffs up to 25 percent on several European countries -- including France, Germany, Britain and Denmark -- in response to their opposition to his plans to take Greenland.Trump's threats have sparked warnings of retaliation at the World Economic Forum meeting in Davos, with European Union chief Ursula von der Leyen saying that the 27-nation bloc would be ""unflinching"" in its response.In his",2026-01-22,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/ahead-of-market-10-things-that-will-decide-stock-market-action-on-thursday/articleshow/127013243.cms,neutral,economictimes,,,,1

Rising memory chip prices weigh down Dixon stock,"New Delhi: A surge in memory-chip (DRAM) prices, regulatory overhang and a flat quarterly growth have weighed on the stock ofDixon Technologies, India's largest Android handset maker. The stock, which slumped to a 52-week low last week, fell a further 5% Tuesday and another 1.16% on Wednesday.The company makes smartphones for the leading Android brands in the country including Xiaomi, Motorola, Vivo, Oppo, Transsion, and Realme.Market trackers attributed the slump to three reasons: Risk to volume and margin from FY27 due to pending government approvals of joint ventures, massive surge in memory prices impactingsmartphone demand, and the anticipation of a weak growth in December quarter.Analysts also said the production-linked incentive (PLI) scheme for mobile phones coming to an end this March will hit electronics manufacturer the hardest.""While Dixon has a strategy in place to mitigate risk to margin and volumes, execution has been delayed, which one could argue, is due to factors beyond Dixon's control,""JM Financialsaid in a report.Live EventsAgenciesInvestors fret over margin pressure, muted demandA global crunch in supply of memory chips has impacted demand forbudget smartphones, which comprise much of Dixon's volumes, analysts said. Memory makes up around 20% of the bill of materials for budget phones. Prices could rise by 30% by April 2026.""Dixon originally projected a volume of 40 million units for FY26. We expect this to drop to approximately 37-37.5 million units,"" said Neel Mehta, senior research associate at Equirus Securities.JM Financial said PLIs have historically contributed around 60 basis points to the margin in Dixon's mobile business, which is around 4-5%. This will be impacted once the scheme ends. The company was also sharing incentives with customers who were unable to get the benefits from the scheme directly, which acted as a differentiator.Dixon has taken steps to mitigate the impact, including investing in components manufacturing and inkin",2026-01-22,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/rising-memory-chip-prices-weigh-down-dixon-stock/articleshow/126536621.cms,neutral,economictimes,,,,1

Jane Street India unit saw trading gains soar 494% before curbs,"Jane Street GroupLLC’s unit in India reported an almost six-fold jump intrading gainsfor the financial year ended March before its operations were brought to an abrupt halt by the regulator on allegations ofmarket manipulationlast year.Net trading gains after accounting for transaction charges stood at 47 billion rupees ($517 million) for the year atJSI Investment Pvt.— a unit of Jane Street Group — compared with 7.9 billion rupees the previous year, filings with the Indian government showed. After-tax profit was 28.4 billion rupees, up 494% from a year ago.The financial results cast new light on the scale of Jane Street’s trading operations in India, where the company is currently facing investigations by the stock market regulator. The confrontation between the Securities and Exchange Board of India and one of Wall Street’s most successful trading firms has drawn global attention, prompting heightened scrutiny of such outfits in other markets, including China.Other trading firms including Hudson River Trading LLC and Optiver Holding BV also posted strong profit growth in India despite regulatory curbs, showcasing their agility in tapping opportunities across the country’s equity market. Following the probes, many companies shifted away from high-frequency options strategies.Trading ProbesNew York-based Jane Street was accused by SEBI of manipulating the local stock market in a July 3 interim order.

"Auto upcycle gains depth; M&M and TVS Motors stand out, Siddhartha Khemka explains","The domestic automobile sector continues to display resilient momentum, with demand sustaining well beyond the festive period. Aggregate industry volumes in the December quarter expanded 17% year-on-year, supported by healthy traction across all major segments.Two-wheelers and passenger vehicles both recorded 17% growth, while commercial vehicles rose 22% and tractors advanced 21%.Importantly, retail momentum in November and December remained firm, indicating that festive-led buying was not a one-off spike but part of a broader recovery trend.Strong volume recovery is translating into robust financial performance. Sector revenues are expected to grow around 24% year-on-year, while operating profit and net profit are projected to rise by about 27% each.Input costs have edged up sequentially due to higher precious metal prices, but this has been partly offset by softer steel prices, moderation in discounts—particularly in passenger vehicles—and operating leverage benefits.Live EventsAggregate EBITDA margins are estimated to improve marginally by around 30 basis points year-on-year to nearly 13.5%, with no major players expected to see a meaningful margin contraction.Ancillary suppliers are also benefiting from the recovery in original equipment demand. Revenues in this segment are estimated to grow by roughly 14%, with EBITDA and profit expected to rise by about 17% and 20%, respectively.Tyre manufacturers are seeing margin expansion on the back of lower raw material costs, while select component manufacturers are reporting sharp margin recovery from a low base, even as a few niche players continue to face pressure.Several structural and near-term trends are reinforcing the outlook. Entry-level vehicles in both two-wheelers and passenger vehicles are witnessing a visible pickup in demand following recent tax rationalisation measures.Strong wholesales and healthy retail sales have kept inventories lean, which should support volume momentum into the next quarter.

"Motilal Oswal sees 8% YoY growth in Nifty Q3 earnings; SBI, Eternal among 5 top ideas","The October-December quarter earnings are expected to register their highest growth in eight quarters on an improved earnings environment, with the Nifty likely delivering an 8% year-on-year growth,Motilal OswalFinancial Services (MOFSL) said in a note. Meanwhile, earnings by companies under MOFSL’s coverage universe may report a 25% year-on-year growth.Excluding financials, earnings for the MOFSL universe and the Nifty 50 are expected to grow 19% and 9% YoY, respectively. Further, barring metals and oil & gas (O&G), earnings are projected to rise 14% YoY for the MOFSL universe and 11% YoY for the Nifty 50, highlighting broad-based growth across several sectors.The overall earnings momentum in Q3FY26 is expected to be driven by oil & gas, where profits are estimated to jump 25% YoY, and financials, led by NBFC lending companies with a 26% growth.Automobiles are projected to deliver a 25% YoY increase in earnings, while metals are seen growing 15%. Telecom profits are expected to jump 2.6 times over a low base in Q3FY25, while technology sector earnings are likely to rise 8%.Other key contributors include real estate, where earnings are projected to surge 64% YoY, capital goods at 24%, cement at 66%, and NBFC non-lending firms at 31%.

"Moody’s affirms Shriram Finance’s Ba1 rating, outlook revised to positive after MUFG Bank investment","Moody’s Ratings has affirmed the Ba1 long-term corporate family rating (CFR) ofShriram FinanceLimited (SFL) and revised its outlook to positive from stable. The rating action follows SFL’s announcement of a planned strategic investment by MUFG Bank.According to Moody’s, the outlook revision reflects expectations that SFL’s business and financial profile will strengthen over the coming quarters. This is based on MUFG Bank's plans to acquire a 20% stake in SFL through a preferential allotment of shares worth Rs 396 billion (approximately $4.4 billion).The transaction is subject to regulatory approvals and is expected to close in 2026.Moody’s noted that the investment will provide SFL with strategic benefits, including a stronger capital base, improved access to global funding channels, and enhanced risk management practices. The rating agency expects that SFL’s capitalisation will materially improve after the transaction, while profitability is expected to strengthen gradually as the company’s cost of funds declines.Additionally, both onshore and offshore funding access are likely to improve.Live EventsOn a pro forma basis, the capital infusion is projected to increase the company’s tangible common equity to tangible managed assets (TCE/TMA) ratio to over 29%, compared to 19% as of March 2025.This would place SFL among the highest capitalisednon-bank finance companiesin India. Moody’s expects the company to maintain a TCE/TMA ratio above 20% over the next four to five years, taking into account its credit growth.SFL’s profitability is also expected to strengthen over the next 12 to 18 months, supported by lower funding costs and improved access to liquidity following the transaction. Moody’s projects a reduction of about 100 basis points in SFL’s cost of funds over the next two years.The company’s 12-month debt maturity coverage ratio is also anticipated to rise to over 90%, up from 31% in March 2025. This improvement is attributed to the large capital injection, alth",2026-01-22,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/moodys-affirms-shriram-finances-ba1-rating-outlook-revised-to-positive-after-mufg-bank-investment/articleshow/126448765.cms,neutral,economictimes,,,,1

"Mid-day Mood | Cooling volatility sparks market rally, India VIX sees steepest fall in 4 years","Benchmark Sensex and Nifty indices continued to trade in green on April 23 afternoon, led by gains in realty stocks. The rally helped ease market volatility as India VIX, which measures near-term volatility, fell sharply by 19 percent, last seen in May 2019. Around noon, the Sensex was up 263.09 points or 0.36 percent at 73,911.71, and the Nifty was up 83.80 points or 0.38 percent at 22,420.20. The market breadth was in favour of gainers as around 2,155 shares advanced, 1,039 declined, and 82 traded unchanged. Meanwhile, broader markets outperformed the benchmarks, with the BSE Midcap and BSE Smallcap rising up to 0.9 percent each. Follow our live blog for all the market action Sectoral trend Barring Nifty Pharma, all sectors traded with gains on April 23 afternoon. Nifty Realty index was the top sectoral performer led by gains in DLF, Macrotech Developers, Godrej Properties, and Phoenix Mills. Fundamental view V K Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist, Geojit Financial Services said that external factors like the high bond yields in the US (the 10-year continues above 4.6 percent) and geopolitical concerns in the Middle East are not impacting the underlying bullish trend. ""FPI selling triggered by high US bond yields is neutralised by aggressive DII buying, putting the FPIs on the back foot,"" he said. Technical view Deven Mehata, Research Analyst at Choice Broking expects Nifty to find support at 22,300 followed by 22,200 and 22,150.

"Adani Power, Tata Motors among 8 stocks with up to 72% upside as brokerages initiate coverage","A host of domestic and global brokerages have initiated coverage on select Indian stocks across sectors such as broking, financials, IT, and auto. Analysts are bullish on major names such as Adani Power, Groww, Coforge, Tata Motors, and forecast an upside of up to 72% from current market levels. Here is a list of 8 stocks on which brokerages initiated coverage this week. Domestic brokerage firm JM Financial initiated coverage on the stock with a ‘Buy’ rating, setting a target price of Rs 178 per share. This implies a potential upside of 20.2% from the current market price of approximately Rs 148. The brokerage’s optimism stems from the company’s strong execution capabilities, dominant position in the thermal power space, and the robust demand outlook for power in India. Domestic brokerage firm InCred Equities initiated coverage with an Add rating and a target price of Rs 513, implying an upside of over 18% from current market levels. The commercial vehicle (CV) business cycle appears to be turning, with momentum expected to build after a prolonged downcycle that played out over six quarters between April 2024 and July 2025. Shares of Billionbrains Garages Ventures can rally as much as 19% from current market levels, Motilal Oswal said after initiating coverage with a Buy rating and a target price of Rs 185 per share. Analysts say Groww continues to maintain a strong competitive position in the broking space, with its cash ADTO (average daily turnover) market share holding steady at 23–24%. Choice Institutional Equities initiated coverage on the stock with a Buy call and a target price of Rs 1,880. That’s an upside of 72% from current market levels. The company is fast-tracking global expansion through strategic partnerships and capability-led acquisitions. Collaborations with Finastra, FIS, Murex, and MasterCard enhance product reach, co-innovation, and client access, driving partnership-led revenue to rise from ~20% in FY22 to over 45% by FY26E.

Strong Q3 sales and rising gold demand lift jewellery stocks,"Mumbai: Shares of gold jewellery companies rallied on Wednesday as strong third-quarter updates from large players such asTitan Company,Kalyan Jewellers IndiaandSenco Goldlifted market sentiment.The positive share price momentum could extend into the coming quarters, supported by risinggold pricesand sustained sales growth, analysts said. Shares of Senco Gold advanced 11.7% on Wednesday, whereas Kalyan andTitangained 4% each.Other players likeTribhovandas Bhimji Zaveri(TBZ),Thangamayil Jewellery, PN Gadgil Jewellers,PC JewellerandBlueStone Jewellery and Lifestylemoved up between 2% and 16% even as benchmark indices Sensex and Nifty slipped for the third straight day. ""Large jewellery players like Titan, Kalyan and Senco reported strong sales growth this quarter, driven not only by strong ornaments demand but also by increased investor interest in gold coins amid price appreciation in Q3, which led to a pop in shares across the sector on Wednesday,"" said Harsh Thakkar, research analyst at Samco Securities.Titan's jewellery business grew 41% year-on-year in Q3, while Senco's revenue was up 51% andKalyan Jewellerssaw a consolidated revenue growth of approximately 42%, the companies said in exchange filings. Thakkar said this growth has also been supported by international operations at Titan and Kalyan Jewellers, along with aggressive store expansion and good same-store sales growth.Analysts said this momentum could continue this quarter. ""Management commentary suggests this momentum could extend into Q4, supporting the recent upside in stock prices,"" said Arijit Malakar, equity research analyst at Ashika Stock Broking. ""While the December quarter is seasonally strong due to festive and wedding demand, we expect value-led growth to persist and demand to remain resilient despite higher gold prices.""Live EventsMalakar said a large part of the growth was also driven by a nearly 12% rise in gold prices during the quarter rather than volume expansion.

"A steep fall & a swift bounce: Cupid up 450% in a year, recovers from 36% correction. Buy or wait?","Cupid Ltdhas had a blockbuster run over the past year, surging an eye-popping 451.60% and generating multibagger returns that caught the eye of retail and institutional investors alike. From a six-month gain of over 300% to a 102% jump in the last three months alone, the stock’s trajectory was a near-vertical climb until volatility struck.On January 2, the stock witnessed a sharp sell-off, crashing 36% from its peak, followed by a gap-down opening the very next session.Just when it looked like the rally had run out of steam, Cupid staged a swift recovery in the last two sessions, jumping up on strong volumes. With the sudden turbulence, market watchers are left questioning: is this a healthy pause in a larger uptrend, or a turning point?What are charts revealing?Aakash Shah, Research Analyst at Choice Broking, says the recent correction in Cupid was a short-termprofit bookingevent rather than a breakdown of the broader trend. He notes that the stock found support near the 50-day EMA and rebounded sharply, signalling buying interest at lower levels.Live Events“The recovery above the 50-day EMA, along with a strong bounce from the 20-day EMA, confirms that the uptrend remains intact. Momentum indicators have reset from overbought zones, which suggests seller exhaustion and scope for stabilisation,” Shah explains.He adds that structurally, the Rs 360–Rs 350 zone acts as a strong demand area, and holding above this region keeps the bullish setup valid.According to Shah, a sustained move above Rs 430–Rs 440 could trigger a breakout and pave the way for a retest of the Rs 480–Rs 500 levels.Caution still prevailsHowever, not all analysts are as optimistic in the near term. Jigar S Patel, Senior Manager - Technical Research Analyst at Anand Rathi Shares and Stock Brokers, takes a more guarded approach.He points out that the sharp 36% fall from the recent high reflects intense profit-booking pressure and suggests a weakening of the medium-term structure, especially since the",2026-01-22,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/a-steep-fall-and-a-swift-bounce-cupid-shares-up-450-in-a-year-rebound-after-sharp-36-correction-should-you-buy/articleshow/126387625.cms,neutral,economictimes,,,,1

"Bajaj Electricals shares surge 11%, competitor stocks tumble up to 5%. What’s happening?","Shares ofBajaj Electricals Ltd. surged sharply on Tuesday, January 20, rising as much as 11% to an intraday high of Rs 468, after the company announced its foray into the wires segment, a move aimed at expanding and diversifying its business operations amid rising demand in the category.The company said the wires business will be introduced as a new product line under its Lighting Solutions segment, signalling a strategic expansion within an existing vertical.Bajaj Electricalshighlighted that demand in the wires industry has been on the rise and that the entry is expected to contribute meaningfully to sustainable long-term growth.In a regulatory filing, Bajaj Electricals clarified that it plans to launch the new wire products shortly, after which it will closely monitor market response to determine the scale of investments required. The company noted that the eventual investment outlay will be guided by several factors, including the size of the opportunity, operational requirements, and prevailing external conditions.Currently, the Lighting Solutions segment operates at margins of around 10%, which are broadly in line with margins seen across the cables and wires industry, where peers typically report margins in the 10–12% range.However, the announcement weighed on shares of existing players in the housing wires segment. Stocks such asRR Kabel,Havells, andFinolex Cablesdeclined by up to 5% during the same trading session, reflecting concerns over increased competition in the space.Live EventsIn a recent interview with ET NOW, market expert Sandip Sabherwal underscored the resilience of the wires and cables segment, even as other areas of the construction ecosystem remain sluggish. He pointed out that growth in wires and cables has been consistently strong, standing out against the relatively muted performance of other construction-linked consumer products.Sabherwal also noted that rising copper prices have not hurt demand, as the cost increases are largely passed t",2026-01-22,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/bajaj-electricals-shares-surge-11-competitor-stocks-tumble-up-to-5-whats-happening/articleshow/126768480.cms,neutral,economictimes,,,,1

"As FIIs pull out and drag India stock market returns, will billion-dollar SIP inflows crack?","Indianequitymarkets have begun 2026 on a shaky note. Foreign investors are selling, global headlines are turning messy, and stock prices have struggled to find direction after a difficult 2025.Niftyis already down 2% this year after underperforming most major equity markets last year. If the markets continue to stay weak and volatile, will systematic investment plans (SIPs) -- the backbone of domestic equity flows -- start to crack?At first glance, the fear seems logical.Equity returnshave disappointed, mid- and smallcap stocks have corrected sharply. But a closer look at the data shows SIPs appear far more resilient than past market cycles.Even as market sentiment weakened throughout the last year, DecemberSIPflows hit a fresh record.SIP inflowsrose to Rs 31,000 crore in December 2025, up from Rs 29,400 crore in November. The broader mutual fund ecosystem also held steady. Monthly average assets under management for the industry remained around Rs 82 lakh crore. Equity assets under management stayed firm at about Rs 35.5 lakh crore.Analysts say this stability indicates that SIPs are not tactical trades, but have become automated habits linked to salaries, long-term goals and financial discipline. Unlike lump-sum investing, SIPs do not require investors to make repeated decisions during market stress.Balasubramanian, Managing Director and CEO of Aditya Birla Sun Life AMC said record inflows are a testament to SIPs increasingly becoming a way of life for Indian investors, while adding that continued investments despite volatility point to rising financial awareness and discipline.Live EventsPoor market returns don't mean poor SIP outcomesWhile stock prices struggled in 2025, SIP investors. Data from an earlier ET report showed that 97% of mutual fund schemes delivered positive returns for SIP investors during the year, with XIRRs going as high as 37%.

Backed by multiple growth triggers, they suggest there is still a comfortable upside left as investors step into the new year, and here’s why.Operational resilienceTata Steel’s asset profile continues to improve, with a rising contribution from its higher-margin India business. The share of India volumes has increased steadily from 33% in FY15 to 68% in FY25 and is expected to rise further to 72% by FY28E, supporting a structurally stronger earnings mix, international brokerage firm Jefferies said in a note. To be sure, analysts at the firm have raised the target to Rs 230 (Buy), an upside potential of 31% from current market levels.The company’s recently commissioned 5 million tonne per annum capacity in India is ramping up and is expected to drive a healthy 6% CAGR in domestic steel volumes over FY25 to FY28E. Tata Steel is also setting up a 0.85 million tonne electric arc furnace, which is scheduled for commissioning in March 2026, and is evaluating another EAF. In addition, the company plans to commence a 5 million tonne per annum expansion at NINL in the coming months, further strengthening its India footprint.Live EventsGovernment supportIndia has imposed a three-year import tariff ⁠of between 11% and 12% on some steel products, according to a finance ministry order published on December 30, as the government ‌aims ‌to curb cheap shipments from China.The India",2026-01-22,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/best-performing-tata-stock-of-2025-may-also-have-a-strong-2026-heres-why-analysts-are-bullish/articleshow/126366602.cms,neutral,economictimes,,,,1

Banks narrow NBFCs’ lead as India’s gold loan market turns nearly 50-50,"Mumbai: Banks are rapidly gaining ground in India's fast-growing gold loan market, challenging the longstanding dominance ofnon-bank lenders.NBFCs' share of aggregategold loansfell by nearly 20 percentage points over the past five years to 50.3% as of March 2025, from 69.4% in 2020. In the same period, banks increased their share to 49.7% from 30.6%, data showed.The shift comes amid a sharp expansion in gold-backed lending, driven by easy liquidity conditions, aggressive pricing by banks, and a surge ingold pricesboosting both borrower demand and lender appetite.According to the Reserve Bank of India's Financial Stability Report, combined gold loans of banks and NBFCs accounted for 5.8% of total outstanding loans as of September-end. Loan books also expanded after lenders began reclassifyinggold-backed loans, originally given for agricultural activity, as gold loans in line withRBI's master circular on gold loans.Banks' share in the gold loan market jumped by 9.6 percentage points in a year to 49.7% in FY25 from 40.1% a year earlier, highlighting the speed with which banks scaled up.Live EventsGold loans have emerged as the fastest-growing loan portfolio over the past year, more than doubling in the last six months on a year-on-year basis, RBI data showed. Outstanding gold loans surged to ₹1.59 lakh crore by November 2024, from ₹89,898 crore in November 2023, before accelerating to ₹3.5 lakh crore by November-end 2025.Bankers say demand for gold loans started gaining currency during the pandemic, when the RBI temporarily relaxed loan-to-value (LTV) norms to support credit growth and household liquidity. The regulatory easing allowed banks to enter the segment more aggressively, leveraging their lower funding costs and wider branch networks to compete with NBFCs on pricing and reach.The latest rally in gold prices has further fuelled growth.

"'Too cheap to ignore': Jefferies initiates coverage on Emmvee Photovoltaic, sees 70% upside","India's solar manufacturing story is entering a phase of rapid scale-up, and Jefferies believes select domestic players are well placed to benefit from this transition. In a new report, the global brokerage has initiated coverage onEmmvee Photovoltaic Powerwith a Buy rating and a target price of Rs 320, a 70% upside from current levels, citing strong growth visibility, policy support and attractive valuations.Jefferies expects India's annual solar installations to grow at a 24% CAGR between FY25 and FY28, driven by falling solar tariffs, rising power demand and the increasing adoption of battery energy storage systems.According to the brokerage, solar power tariffs have consistently stayed below the cost of new thermal power over the past four years, making solar the preferred choice for utilities and industrial users.The recent discovery of solar-plus-storage tariffs in the range of Rs 3-3.5 per unit has further strengthened the case for renewables. Jefferies notes that these tariffs imply battery storage costs of Rs 4.5-5 per unit, which still compares favourably with marginal thermal power tariffs of Rs 5.4-5.8 per unit. Importantly, solar-plus-storage contracts lock in prices for 25 years, unlike thermal power where costs rise annually.Against this backdrop, Jefferies sees solar emerging as the dominant renewable energy source in India. It estimates annual solar installations to rise to 65 GW by FY28 from about 34 GW in FY25.Live EventsPolicy support remains a key driver for domestic manufacturers. Government rules such as the Approved List of Models and Manufacturers (ALMM) and domestic content requirements for public sector projects have effectively reserved a large part of the market for Indian manufacturers.This has led to a shortage of domestic solar cells, pushing up module prices and improving profitability for local players. Jefferies expects similar policy protection to eventually extend to upstream segments like ingots and wafers.Emmvee, according to t",2026-01-22,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/too-cheap-to-ignore-jefferies-initiates-coverage-on-emmvee-photovoltaic-sees-70-upside/articleshow/126355024.cms,neutral,economictimes,,,,1

He noted that these reports were circulated by global social media handles, often citing unnamed sources.Chadha also flagged claims that former US President Donald Trump had approved 500% tariffs on India, calling them misleading. “Too much disinformation,” he said, adding that such rumours tend to surface frequently around weekly or monthly derivatives expiry sessions, amplifying volatility.""Tuesday News on sanctioned Russian oil headed to India.

Banks bank on cash recyclers in new ATM cycle,"Mumbai: ATMs are staging a strong comeback in India, aggressive deployment plans from state-run banks showed, as lenders increasingly pivot towardcash recyclersto boost efficiency and cut operating costs.Over the next six months, up to the first quarter of FY27, banks have floated requests for proposals (RFPs) for nearly 17,350 ATMs, withUnion Bank of India,Bank of India,Canara BankandIndian Banktogether accounting for more than 8,000 machines.What appears to be a contraction in India's ATM base is, in fact, a technology-led transition from conventional ATMs to cash recyclers. Of the total RFPs floated, around 13,100 are for cash recyclers, indicating a strong preference for recycler-led deployments, which account for more than 75% of the planned installations.Among upcoming cash recycler tenders over the next six months, Union Bank of India plans to deploy around 2,000 machines, Bank of India about 3,700, Canara Bank nearly 1,500, and Indian Bank roughly 1,006.""We see a fair bit of bank outsourcing and the RFP cycle coming up again in 2026,"" said Anush Raghavan, chief business officer atCMS Info Systems. ""The last wave of asset replacement or expansion was seen in 2023 and 2024. In 2025, we had an increase in ATM interchange fees, which typically leads to expansion of the market and higher outsourcing. But 2025 was bookended by various disruptions, so we expect 2026 to see more RFPs and greater outsourcing activity.""Live EventsIn 2025, the collapse of one of the largest ATM service providers, AGS Transact-which once operated nearly 40,000 ATMs-forced several banks to either shut down older machines or migrate to new service providers. This transition has accelerated the adoption of newer technologies, particularly cash recyclers, as banks look to ensure continuity of service while lowering cash-handling costs and downtime.An industry executive, who did not wish to be named, said banks are now being far more deliberate in their deployment strategy.

"Sebi proposes uniform 30-day lag for sharing, use of price data for education","Market regulator Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) has proposed a uniform 30-day lag for both sharing and usage of price data for educational and awareness activities. In a consultation paper released on Tuesday, the regulator noted that the 30-day lag would suffice to protect against misuse of exchange data while keeping the education content relevant.Currently, stock exchanges share live data only for the purpose of trading and its related activities. The regulator prescribed a one-day time lag for educational and awareness activities through a circular issued on May 24, 2024. Subsequently, Sebi’s circular dated January 29, 2025 further tightened the framework by specifying that entities engaged solely in education may use market data only with a three-month lag.While both circulars address data usage, their objectives differ. The May 2024 circular permits limited data sharing for education with a one-day delay, whereas the January 2025 circular governs how old such data must be when used exclusively for educational purposes, prescribing a three-month delay.Sebi received stakeholder comments that the one-day time lag was too short, and that there were possible cases of misuse of one-day time lag data, making out a case for increasing the time lag to a larger period.Meanwhile, Sebi's internal deliberations took the regulator to a conclusion that three-month lag was too long and that the educational input could be more efficient if the period is reduced.Live Events""In this regard, it is felt that a time lag of 30 days for both sharing and usage of price data would suffice the purpose of protecting against misuse of exchange data as well as keeping the education content relevant,"" the consultation paper said.The paper also proposed that persons engaged solely in education will continue to abide by the prohibited activities provisions mentioned in the January 2025 circular and that all the other provisions will remain unchanged.Sebi has sought public feedb",2026-01-22,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/sebi-proposes-uniform-30-day-lag-for-sharing-use-of-price-data-for-education/articleshow/126375667.cms,neutral,economictimes,,,,1

"What Sebi’s 15% 'hard ceiling' on open interest means for broker growth, customers: Zerodha’s Nithin Kamath explains","Zerodhafounder and CEONithin Kamathsaid the 15% open interest (OI) cap at the broker level places a hard ceiling on how much a broking firm can grow and the pace of that growth. While the restriction limits scale, it ultimately benefits consumers by reducingconcentration riskand preventing any single broker from becoming too dominant.Kamath also called broking a unique business while giving an insight into what goes inside it.""Broking is a unique business because there's a hard ceiling on how much we can grow and the rate at which we can grow. What most people don't realise is that SEBI has set a 15% open interest (OI) cap at the broker level,"" Kamath posted on his official X handle on Tuesday.""No single broker can hold more than 15% of the total market OI. This restriction exists to mitigate the risk of concentration from any single broker becoming too large. Concentration is beneficial for business but ultimately detrimental to consumers,"" the tweet said.Drawing a parallel with UPI applications, Kamath said that the National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) has created a similar restriction on third-party UPI applications though the measure was never implemented.Live Events""This is similar to the 33% market share restriction that NPCI imposed on third-party UPI apps. That measure was never implemented because it would've meant UPI apps stopping transactions, but in our case, the limit is applicable,"" Kamath said.Also read:Zerodha’s late MTF entry still nets 5% market share but Nithin Kamath flags cost blind spotHow Zerodha has benefitted?Kamath said that the only way individual brokers can grow is if other brokers also grow, and fortunately for Zerodha, the overall market has grown helping the firm to maintain its 15% OI market share for the last five years.""For us to grow, the overall market must grow, and that means other brokers must also do well.

Federal Bank shares zoom 11% to fresh 52-week high after strong Q3 results,"Federal Bankon Friday reported a strong financial performance for the third quarter of FY26, posting a net profit of Rs 1,041.21 crore, an 8.98% year-on-year (YoY) growth and 9% sequential (QoQ) rise.The surge in bottom line was driven by higher core income, stable margins, and continued operating leverage, as the lender maintained its momentum across key verticals.The bank’s Net Interest Income (NII), a key measure of a bank’s income from core lending operations, came in at Rs 2,652.73 crore, reflecting a 9.11% YoY increase and 6.31% QoQ growth.

The improvement in margins was supported by a favourable liability mix and asset repricing benefits, according to the bank.Live EventsFurther, the Operating Profit rose to Rs 1,729.33 crore, up 10.19% YoY and 5.18% QoQ, reflecting the strength of core earnings and the bank’s focus on cost control. Fee income also rose significantly, increasing 18.57% YoY to Rs 896.47 crore, underlining the bank’s growing non-interest income streams and improved customer engagement.The bank’s total business (advances + deposits) expanded to Rs 5,53,364.49 crore, registering a growth of 11.40% YoY and 3.71% QoQ.

Rs 1 lakh crore wipeout! RIL shares sink nearly 5% to log worst single-day fall since June 2024,"Reliance IndustriesLimited (RIL) shares plunged 5% to an intraday low of Rs 1,497.05 on the BSE on Tuesday after the company denied a Bloomberg report that claimed three vessels carrying Russian crude oil were headed to its Jamnagar refinery, calling the report “blatantly untrue.”This marks the stock’s biggest intraday fall since June 4, 2024. The stock slipped below its 50-day moving average, eroding over Rs 1 lakh crore in market capitalisation during the session. The stock ended 4.30% lower at Rs 1509.55 apiece on the BSE.Reliancealso emerged as the largest drag on the Nifty 50, contributing to a decline of about 82 points in the benchmark index.In a statement posted on X, the company said its Jamnagar refinery has not received any Russian oil cargo in the past three weeks and is not expecting any Russian crude deliveries in January. RIL added that it was “deeply pained” that its denial was ignored, leading to the publication of what it described as an incorrect report that tarnished its image.— RIL_Updates (@RIL_Updates)Live EventsThe Bloomberg report, citing Kpler data, had suggested that three vessels laden with Russian crude were heading to Reliance’s Jamnagar refinery. Reliance, which was earlier India’s largest buyer of discounted Russian oil following the Russia-Ukraine war, has now paused such purchases.According to Reuters, with Reliance halting Russian crude intake, India’s oil imports from Russia are expected to decline further in January. The report added that Russian oil flows to India have already slowed due to tighter U.S. and European Union sanctions, with imports falling to a three-year low of about 1.2 million barrels per day in December, down roughly 40% from a June peak of around 2 million barrels per day.Despite the company’s clarification, Reliance shares remained under pressure through the session amid heavy trade volumes, as investors reacted to the news flow and broader market weakness.(Disclaimer: Recommendations, suggestions, views and",2026-01-22,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/reliance-industries-shares-decline-4-amid-heavy-volumes-emerges-as-third-biggest-drag-on-nifty/articleshow/126366034.cms,neutral,economictimes,,,,1

BHEL shares tumble 6% as Chinese import fears resurface. Should investors buy this dip?,"Shares ofBharat Heavy Electricals Ltd(BHEL) slipped as much as 6% to an intraday low of Rs 258.30 on January 12, as investors reassessed reports that India may ease restrictions on Chinese firms bidding for government contracts. The development has raised concerns about intensifying competition and potential pressure on pricing and margins for state-run power equipment makers.With the latest decline, the stock is down 15% in three sessions, resuming its downward trend after closing higher in the previous session.What should investors do?BHEL sharesended the previous week about 9% lower, though the stock attempted a partial recovery on Friday after Thursday’s sharp decline. According to Anand James of Geojit Investments, the fall appears to be a single-day event, followed by the formation of an inside bar pattern, which supports the possibility of an upside move in the week ahead. However, he cautioned that the stock breached its 50-day simple moving average for the first time since mid-September and closed below it last week. As a result, he advised waiting for a pullback above Rs 280 as confirmation before turning decisively bullish.What’s ailing the stock?Live EventsThe selloff comes after media reports suggesting that India plans to scrap curbs on Chinese firms bidding for government contracts. These restrictions were introduced in 2020 under the Atmanirbhar Bharat package and subsequent amendments to the General Financial Rules, following India-China border tensions.As part of those measures, bidders from countries sharing a land border with India were required to obtain mandatory political and security clearances, effectively restricting imports from China across sensitive sectors, including power and energy.What are experts saying?International brokerage firm Jefferies struck a cautious tone last week, calling the possible easing of restrictions a “potential negative development” for some industrial players.It said that companies such as BHEL, Afcons, L&T, are",2026-01-22,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/bhel-shares-tumble-15-in-just-two-sessions-should-investors-buy-this-dip/articleshow/126475178.cms,neutral,economictimes,,,,1

L&T shares drop over 4% even as co clarifies rumors of potential cancellation of Kuwait oil projects,"Shares of Larsen & Toubro (L&T) fell 4.5% to an intraday low of Rs 3,836.35 on the BSE on Tuesday even as the company issued a clarification on reports that said Kuwait may cancel oil project tenders worth $8.7 billion.“With reference to the media report regarding discussions on possible cancellation of certain oil project tenders in Kuwait, the Company would like to clarify that the projects referred to in the said report were not part of the Company’s order book,” the company said in an exchange filing.Additionally, the company also stated that it cannot comment on the status of tenders or commercial decisions of its clients.The stock had earlier reacted to the news, first reported by MEED and cited by CNBC-TV18, which said the Kuwait Oil Company (KOC) is reviewing its capital expenditure plans, putting several large tenders at risk.According to MEED, the review was triggered after bids for multiple contracts came in well above the allocated budget, raising concerns over cost efficiency and fiscal impact.

"Jefferies lifts RIL target after Rs 1 lakh crore fall, pins next leg of rally on Jio IPO, tariff hikes","A day afterReliance Industries(RIL) shares fell 4.4%, erasing Rs 94,000 crore in market value, global brokerage Jefferies raised its target price on the bluechip Nifty stock, citing a likely tariff hike at Jio and a potential IPO of the telecom arm as the next major re‑rating triggers for the conglomerate.Jefferies has maintained its Buy rating on RIL and lifted the 12‑month price target to Rs 1,830 per share, rolling forward its sum‑of‑the‑parts valuation to March 2027, implying about 21% upside from the previous close of Rs 1,507.The brokerage’s base‑case assumes 21% EBITDA CAGR at Jio, 14% at Retail, and 6% at the oil‑to‑chemicals (O2C) business over FY25–28, valuing core offline retail at 28x EV/EBITDA and India telecom at 15x on FY27–28 estimates.Also Read |From Campa to Kelvinator: Why Reliance is buying old, nostalgic brandsJio IPO and tariff hike as key triggersJefferies expectsRelianceJio to post 22% year‑on‑year (YoY) revenue growth and 28% EBITDA growth in FY27, driven by a 15% mobile tariff hike around June 2026 and continued strength in home broadband and fixed wireless access (FWA). The report flags an imminent listing of Jio Platforms Ltd in the first half of calendar 2026 as a pivotal event that could unlock equity value, with Jio’s standalone equity pegged at approximately $170 billion, based on a 15× EV/EBITDA multiple for March 2027.Live EventsRetail, FMCG and new energy optionalityOn the consumer side, Jefferies sees Reliance Retail’s revenue rising about 16% in FY27, as store additions pick up following a network‑streamlining drive and revenue per square foot returns to double‑digit growth. EBITDA margin is expected to moderate slightly due to a higher contribution from lower‑margin grocery and JioMart. The brokerage highlights the spin‑off of the fast‑growing FMCG business—now clocking an annualised revenue run‑rate of around US$2.4 billion, with brands such as Campa Cola, Independence, and Lotus Chocolate—as a medium‑term value‑discovery story",2026-01-22,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/jefferies-lifts-ril-target-after-rs-1-lakh-crore-fall-pins-next-leg-of-rally-on-jio-ipo-tariff-hikes/articleshow/126386618.cms,neutral,economictimes,,,,1

The rally pushed the Sensex and Nifty to fresh intraday highs, reversing recent caution and setting a bullish tone for the session.The BSE Sensex jumped as much as 752 points during the day to hit an intraday high of 84,134.97, while the NSE Nifty 50 surged 0.8% to touch 25,873.50.

Sensex suffers the worst start to a year in a decade. What this selloff means for investors?,"India's equity markets have had a rough start to 2026. Data from Ace Equity showed that the benchmarkBSE Sensexfell 1.93% between January 1 and January 10, marking its worst opening stretch to a calendar year in the last 10 years. The last time markets saw a sharper fall in the same period was in 2016, when theSensexhad declined 4.53% amid global growth fears and China-led volatility.The weak start has raised many questions for investors on whether they should be worried, or is this just a temporary setback?What happened in the first 10 days of 2026The sell-off gathered pace in the first full trading week of the year. The Sensex fell 2.55% for the week ended January 9 to close at 83,576, while theNifty50 dropped 2.45% to 25,683. Broader markets fared even worse, with midcap and smallcap indices falling 2.6% and just over 3%, signalling a clear shift to risk aversion.According to Dr Ravi Singh, Chief Research Officer at Master Capital Services, the pressure came from a mix of global shocks and domestic caution. He said markets were hit by rising geopolitical uncertainty after the US approved a Russian sanctions bill that could lead to steep tariffs, including on countries buying Russian energy. This was compounded by the lack of progress on the US–India trade deal, which markets had expected to move forward early in the year.Expectations of mixed Q3 earnings and sustained foreign institutional investor selling added to the negative mood. FIIs sold Indian equities worth Rs 8,808 crore during the week, even as domestic institutional investors bought shares worth Rs 15,700 crore.Live EventsWhy foreign investors are selling againFII behaviour has been central to the weak start. VK Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist at Geojit Investments, said foreign investors entered 2026 continuing the trend seen last year. In 2025, FIIs were net sellers of Indian equities worth Rs 1.66 lakh crore, which also contributed to a nearly 5% fall in the rupee.At the start of 2026, ther",2026-01-22,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/sensex-suffers-the-worst-start-to-a-year-in-a-decade-what-this-selloff-means-for-investors/articleshow/126475158.cms,neutral,economictimes,,,,1

Value buys? Worst-performing India market pushes 25 Nifty stocks below 5-year PE,"After dubbed, world's worst-performing major equity market in 2025, India has begun 2026 too on a fragile footing, rattled by global uncertainty and sustained foreign investor selling. Yet looking beyond the recent volatility, valuation data shows that at least 25 largeNiftystocks are now trading below their own five-year average price-to-earnings multiples.This does not automatically mean the market has turned cheap. But it does mark a shift from the valuation excesses, a sentiment echoed by many brokerages heading into this year.The price-to-earnings ratio compares a company's share price to its earnings per share. A stock trading below its five-year averagePEis valued at a discount to what investors have historically been willing to pay for its earnings. In simple terms, the market is either assuming slower future growth, higher risk, weaker earnings visibility -- or all three.For instance,HDFC Banktrades at a trailing PE of about 19.9 times compared to its five-year average of 20.75. Infosys trades near 23 times versus a five-year average of 27.75.Reliance Industriesis at roughly 24 times against a historical average of 26.6.Even consumer-facing compounders such as Hindustan Unilever, Titan and Asian retail plays like Trent are trading at meaningful discounts to their longer-term valuation bands.Live EventsThe valuation compression of stocks is line poor show of Indian stocks over the last one year. India closed 2025 as the worst-performing major equity market in the world, even as global peers staged powerful rallies. In dollar terms, theSensexand the Nifty50 have delivered returns of just 4-5% in 2025.Foreign investors too have been aggressive sellers in Indian equities over the past one year period. Heavy FII selling tends to compress valuations mechanically. When foreign funds exit largecap stocks, prices fall faster than earnings estimates adjust, pulling down PE multiples.Does this mean value buying has emerged?Valuation compression is a necessary but not",2026-01-22,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/value-buys-worst-performing-india-market-pushes-25-nifty-stocks-below-5-year-pe/articleshow/126496147.cms,neutral,economictimes,,,,1

"Why stock market fell today? Sensex ends 324 points lower, Nifty below 25,650. 5 key factors behind today's sell-off","Indian equities closed lower on Monday, with investors pulling back as global trade-war rhetoric returned to the headlines and heavyweight earnings disappointed at home. The BSE Sensex slid as much as 629 points intraday on Monday, touching a low of 82,941.01, while the NSE Nifty 50 fell 0.7% to an intraday low of 25,504.85.At the end of the day, the Sensex ended about 324 points, or 0.39%, lower at 83,246.18, while the Nifty shed 109 points, or 0.42%, to 25,585.50, as risk appetite waned.The broader damage was visible in market wealth as well, with the total market capitalization of BSE-listed companies shrinking by Rs 2.42 lakh crore to Rs 465.39 lakh crore.Here are the key factors behind the market fall:1. Trump’s Greenland tariff threat revives trade-war fearsSentiment took a hit after U.S. President Donald Trump vowed to impose a fresh round of tariffs on eight European countries unless Washington is allowed to buy Greenland. Trump said the U.S. would levy an additional 10% import tariff from February 1 on goods from Denmark, Norway, Sweden, France, Germany, the Netherlands, Finland and the U.K., with the rate rising to 25% from June 1 if no agreement is reached.Live EventsThe remarks rattled global markets and pushed investors toward safe havens. Asian equities fell across the board, while U.S. stock-index futures slid in thin holiday trading, with S&P 500 futures down 0.8% and Nasdaq futures off 1.1%. European futures were also under pressure, with Euro Stoxx 50 and DAX futures dropping 1.3% and FTSE futures down 0.6%. Japan’s Nikkei declined 1.4%, and MSCI’s Asia-Pacific index excluding Japan edged down 0.3%.It’s going to be volatile days ahead in the near-term for stock markets globally with big geopolitical and geoeconomic developments impacting markets, said Dr. VK Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist at Geojit Investments, adding that ""We don’t know now how President Trump’s disruptive policies are going to impact international trade and global econo",2026-01-22,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/why-is-stock-market-falling-today-sensex-cracks-over-600-points-nifty-below-25550-5-key-factors-behind-todays-sell-off/articleshow/126668757.cms,neutral,economictimes,,,,1

"Meesho shares in focus as firm enters logistics business, incorporates subsidiary","Shares of newly-listedMeeshowill be in focus heading into trade on Tuesday, January 13, after the company announced it will incorporate a subsidiary, marking its entry into the logistics business.“The main objects of the newly to-be-incorporated subsidiary is engaging in the business of logistics service provider for the movement of goods and undertake activities relating to loading, unloading, in-transit storage, handling and trans-shipment of goods through third-party service providers, as incidental or ancillary to transportation services,” the company said in a regulatory filing on January 12.Meesho did not disclose the name of the subsidiary and stated: “Upon incorporation of the entity, the company shall make a separate disclosure disclosing the name of the entity.” Share Capital for the entity shall be Rs 1 lakh, it added.On Monday, BofA Securities initiated coverage on newly listed e-commerce firm Meesho Ltd with a 'Neutral' rating and a price target of Rs 190 per share, a 14%upside from current levels. Logistics was identified as a monetisation driver. BofA said Meesho’s ability to serve value-focused users efficiently stems from its efforts to consistently reduce logistics costs. The brokerage noted that Meesho focuses on keeping logistics costs low for sellers rather than extracting profits from its logistics network, a strategy that helps sellers list a wider range of affordable products.Sensex, Nifty today: Catch all the LIVE stock market action hereLive EventsThe brokerage highlighted Meesho’s shift in its advertising model and its approach to logistics as key elements shaping the company’s longer-term outlook. At the same time, the brokerage’s neutral stance signals caution as the stock transitions from listing-driven momentum to closer scrutiny of execution and valuation.Meesho sharescontinue to trade well above their IPO price. The stock is up about 46% from its issue price of Rs 111, although it has slipped 36% from its post-listing peak of Rs 254.",2026-01-22,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/meesho-shares-in-focus-as-firm-enters-logistics-business-incorporates-subsidiary/articleshow/126496055.cms,neutral,economictimes,,,,1

Sensex slips 800 points and Nifty sees a decisive breakdown. Can investors ignore Trump to buy the dip?,"Indian equity markets extended their losing streak for the fourth straight session as geopolitical tensions and renewed fears of aggressive US tariff action rattled investor confidence. The Sensex slipped nearly 800 points in Thursday’s session, marking a decisive breakdown after a week of consolidation, while the Nifty 50 fell sharply below crucial technical levels, raising questions about whether the recent correction offers a buying opportunity or signals deeper trouble ahead.The Nifty closed the day down 1%, slipping below the 25,900 mark in what analysts described as a technically significant move.SBISecurities said the index broke down from its rising channel on the daily chart and, more importantly, ended below its 50-day exponential moving average for the first time since early October.That level had previously acted as strong support on three separate occasions, making the breach a clear negative signal for short-term momentum. Technical indicators echoed the weakness, with the daily relative strength index also slipping below its rising channel, reinforcing the bearish undertone.Market breadth deteriorated sharply as selling pressure broadened across sectors. As many as 45 of the Nifty’s 50 constituents ended the session in the red.Hindalco IndustriesandWiproemerged as the biggest losers among frontline stocks, whileEternalandSBI Life Insurancemanaged to close higher, offering limited support to the indices.Sectorally, losses were widespread, with all major indices ending lower. Metal, oil and gas, and PSU bank stocks were among the worst hit, reflecting broad-based risk aversion rather than stock-specific triggers.Live EventsThe correction was even more severe in the broader market. The Nifty Midcap 100 and Nifty Smallcap 100 both fell close to 2%, underperforming the benchmark indices. The midcap index slipped below its 20-day EMA, while the smallcap index breached all its key moving averages, a sign that sentiment in the broader market has weakened mate",2026-01-22,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/sensex-slips-800-points-and-nifty-sees-a-decisive-breakdown-can-investors-ignore-trump-to-buy-the-dip/articleshow/126413655.cms,neutral,economictimes,,,,1

HDFC Bank shares fall 5% in 2 days after Q3 update. Should you buy this dip?,"Shares ofHDFC Bankslipped for the second consecutive day, declining 4.5% in 2 days to a low of Rs 955.9 on the BSE. The fall comes on the heels of the lender’s Q3FY26 business update, which was released yesterday.While the update showed healthy year-on-year growth in advances and deposits, the stock came under pressure amid broader market sentiment and concerns over deposit traction.As per the update, the bank’s average advances under management for the quarter stood at Rs 28.64 lakh crore, reflecting a growth of around 9% over Rs 26.28 lakh crore in the corresponding quarter last year.On a period-end basis, advances under management were approximately Rs 29.46 lakh crore as of December 31, 2025, marking a 9.8% increase over Rs 26.84 lakh crore as of December 31, 2024.Following the update, Nomura has offered its take on whether this correction presents a buying opportunity. Global brokerage firm Nomura has reiterated its ‘Buy’ rating, assigning a target price of Rs 1,120.Live EventsThe brokerage highlighted that both loan and deposit growth remained modest in Q3. It added that the CD ratio nearly touching 100% could constrain future loan growth, making deposit mobilisation crucial for sustaining credit expansion.Nomura believes that improved traction on deposits will be key for driving acceleration in loan growth and reiterated its positive stance on the stock despite near-term concerns.“We believe constrained deposit growth has weighed on loan growth this quarter as its CD ratio almost touched the 100% mark. Strong deposit mobilisation remains key for the bank to drive acceleration in loan growth going forward,” the brokerage firm said in its note.Also read:'Too cheap to ignore': Jefferies initiates coverage on Emmvee Photovoltaic, sees 70% upside(Disclaimer: Recommendations, suggestions, views and opinions given by the experts are their own.

Market Trading Guide: Buy Hindustan Zinc & a midcap stock for up to 8% gains. Sell recommendation on Fortis Healthcare,"Nifty ended sharply lower on Tuesday amid tariff and geopolitical concerns that caused a widespread sell-off across sectors. It was its second successive fall. Technical indicators remain in a bearish crossover and are approaching the oversold zone.Commenting on the day's action, Rupak De, Senior Technical Analyst at LKP Securities said that bears resumed control on Tuesday as bulls were increasingly marginalised amid ongoing transatlantic trade tensions. ""Support looked fragile as the Nifty kept breaking them on the back of strong institutional selling. On the daily chart, the index appears to be drifting towards the 200-DMA. Immediate support is seen around 25,100–25,150. If this level holds, a decent pullback can be expected,"" De said.Here are 3 stock recommendations for Wednesday: Stop Loss: Rs 2,143Target: Rs 2,270Dalmia Bharat has shown resilient price action after forming a strong base near key support levels.

India EU trade deal closer than ever: Jefferies lists 4 sectoral winners for stock market investors,"India’s long pending free trade agreement (FTA) with the European Union is around the corner, with Jefferies saying the proposed deal could materially alter sectoral dynamics for Indian exporters, especially in textiles, autos, electronics and pharma chemicals, while politically sensitive agri and dairy are likely to be kept out.Talks that began in 2007 and stalled in 2013 have seen renewed momentum since 2022, and Jefferies notes that broad agreement on avoiding sensitive items such as agriculture on both sides seems to be culminating in the FTA in the coming few days. The brokerage points out that India’s annual goods trade with the EU is about US$130 billion, similar in size to that with China or the US, with exports to the bloc at an annualised US$75 billion, accounting for 17% of India’s total exports and roughly 1.9% of GDP.India currently runs a sizeable surplus with the EU, helped by a post Russia Ukraine war surge in petroleum product and electronics exports, with Jefferies estimating the goods trade surplus at US$10 to US$15 billion since 2022. Services trade is also significant at US$72 billion, where India enjoys a US$9 billion surplus.Jefferies flags textiles as one of the biggest potential winners from tariff cuts. The EU imports about US$125 billion of textiles and apparel annually, of which India has just a 5 to 6% share, compared with China at 30% and a combined 20% share for Bangladesh and Pakistan. Crucially, Bangladesh and Pakistan already benefit from zero tariffs in the EU, versus duties of up to 10% faced by Indian exporters.“The FTA bringing Indian textile duties on par with its South Asian neighbours will be a key positive,” Jefferies writes in a report, adding that this comes at a time when the US tariff imposition of 50% has significantly hurt the sector’s competitiveness in that market.Live EventsOn autos, Jefferies underlines that a key European ask is better access to India’s passenger vehicle market, where import tariffscurrently go as",2026-01-22,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/india-eu-trade-deal-closer-than-ever-jefferies-lists-4-sectoral-winners-for-stock-market-investors/articleshow/126938736.cms,neutral,economictimes,,,,1

Hindustan Copper shares fall over 4% as copper prices retreat,"Shares ofHindustan Copperfell sharply for the second consecutive session on Thursday, sliding 4.6% to Rs 525.20. Over the past two trading days, the stock has declined by more than 7%, tracking weakness in globalcopper prices.Copper prices on theLondon Metal Exchange(LME) came under pressure, slipping 2.56% to $12,899.50 per metric ton. The decline in the base metal weighed on investor sentiment in metal stocks, including Hindustan Copper, which is directly linked to movements in copper prices.The recent correction comes after a strong rally in the stock. Ahead of the decline,Hindustan Copper shareshad risen for four straight sessions as copper prices surged to record highs. Benchmark copper prices on the LME had climbed as much as 4.4% to around $13,000 per metric tonne, marking a series of sharp gains that pushed the metal up by over 20% since mid-November. However, the latest pullback in copper prices has triggered profit-taking, leading to a decline in Hindustan Copper shares.Hindustan Copper has seen a wide trading range over the past year, with its 52-week high at Rs 575 and a 52-week low of Rs 183.82, highlighting strong volatility in the stock.On the valuation front, the stock appears expensive by conventional metrics. Hindustan Copper is currently trading at a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 93.84, while its price-to-book (P/B) ratio stands at 20.03, both of which are significantly higher than broader market averages.Live EventsFrom a technical perspective, momentum indicators suggest the stock may be overheated in the near term. As per Trendlyne data, the 14-day Relative Strength Index (RSI) stands at 79.5. An RSI reading above 70 typically indicates an overbought condition, suggesting the possibility of a near-term pullback or consolidation.Despite this, the broader trend remains positive. Hindustan Copper is currently trading above 7 of its 8 key simple moving averages (SMAs), staying above all moving averages except the very short-term 5-day SMA, which",2026-01-22,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/hindustan-copper-shares-fall-over-4-as-copper-prices-retreat/articleshow/126407337.cms,neutral,economictimes,,,,1

Domestic markets bounce back after US ambassador calms trade jitters,"Mumbai: Domestic equity indices notched up gains on Monday in a volatile trading session, snapping a five-day losing streak, after US ambassador to India Sergio Gor's assurance that the two countries will discuss trade issues on Tuesday sparked an immediate revival. Markets had fallen over heightened concerns that theUS-India trade dealwas stuck in the wake of a 500% tariff threat by President Donald Trump and recent comments by commerce secretary Howard Lutnick.The NSE Nifty rose 106.95 points or 0.4% to close at 25,790.25. The BSE Sensex climbed 301.93 points or 0.4% to end at 83,878.17. Both indices recovered by nearly 1.2% from their intraday lows as the diplomat's remarks triggered liquidation of some of the bearish bets. Gor was speaking in New Delhi after arriving in the country to take charge as ambassador, having been picked for the job.Late last week, markets fell as Trump backed a bill allowing 500% tariffs on countries that knowingly engage in the exchange of Russian-origin uranium and petroleum products. This caused the indices to shed 2.5% last week, the biggest weekly loss since September.AgenciesFear Gauge Up 4%""The US ambassador's comments gave the market some relief that both sides are actively engaged in firming up a trade deal,"" said Narendra Solanki, head of fundamental research,Anand Rathi Shareand Stock Brokers Ltd, strengthening expectations of an early conclusion to the trade talks.Live EventsLast week's tariff talk had dashed hopes of an India-US trade deal happening soon, seen as crucial for market revival.Momentum indicators were in the oversold zone technically and that aided the quick recovery, said Rohan Shah, technical analyst atAsit C MehtaInvestment Intermediates. But the markets are still precariously placed.""If the index fails to quickly reclaim the 26,000 level, Nifty is likely to resume selling pressure, with downside potential toward the 25,200-25,000 zone,"" he said.Despite market recovery, Nifty's India Volatility Index or VIX",2026-01-22,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/domestic-markets-bounce-back-after-us-ambassador-calms-trade-jitters/articleshow/126494860.cms,neutral,economictimes,,,,1

"Bharat Coking Coal shares fall 7% after stellar debut at 97% premium. Should you buy, sell or hold?","Shares of newly listedBharat Coking CoalLtd (BCCL) declined 7% from their listing high of Rs 45.21 as investors moved to book profits after the stock’s stellar debut. The shares had made a bumper listing on the BSE, debuting at a 97% premium to the issue price of Rs 23 per share, before witnessing selling pressure at higher levels.The Rs 1,071 crore IPO of BharatCoking Coalwitnessed one of the strongest subscription responses in India’s primary market in recent years, attracting bids worth over Rs 1.1 lakh crore. Exchange data showed that investors bid for 50,93,16,75,600 shares at the upper end of the price band of Rs 23, translating into a total bid value of around Rs 1.17 lakh crore.What should investors do?Shivani Nyati, Head of Wealth atSwastika Investmart, recommends traders and short-term investors to consider booking profit. Long-term investors may continue to hold the stock with a stop-loss of Rs 35, keeping a medium-to-long-term perspective. “The stellar listing was driven by strong fundamentals, BCCL’s strategic importance in India’s steel and metallurgical coal supply chain, and a positive outlook for the coal and core infrastructure sector. Strong IPO oversubscription across categories clearly translated into aggressive buying interest on debut,” she added.SBISecurities says strong parentage bodes well for the company. BCCL’s parent company,Coal India, is the largest coal producing company in the world and commanded a market share of 74% in the domestic industry during FY25. BCCL benefits significantly from its strategic support and vast resources such as access to advanced technologies, pool of skilled professionals, and robust financial backing. Additionally, BCCL leverages Coal India’s technical expertise in coal mining and resource management thereby enhancing its market recognition and credibility.Live EventsAlso Read |NFO Insight : Will Parag Parikh Large Cap Fund’s new approach help you sail through market volatility?Prashanth Tapse of Mehta Equi",2026-01-22,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/bharat-coking-coal-shares-fall-7-after-stellar-debut-at-97-premium-should-you-buy-sell-or-hold/articleshow/126669608.cms,neutral,economictimes,,,,1

"LG Electronics India shares can rally another 20%, says JM Financial after initiating coverage with Buy. Check target price","Shares ofLG Electronics Indiacan surge 20% from current market levels, according to domestic brokerage firmJM Financial, after it initiated coverage on the stock with a Buy rating and a target price of Rs 1,630 per share.Among India’s leading home appliances brands, the company retained pole position in the offline channel across categories, including refrigerators, ACs, washing machines and televisions. This dominance, JM believes, is driven by its robust brand recall, edge in technology and innovation, strong parentage and widespread distribution.Further, the company’s close integration with its Korean parent, LG Electronics, remains a key differentiator and a critical factor in helping the company stay ahead of the competition. The partnership spans product innovation and design, with LG India’s own R&D spending at around 0.4% of revenue, complemented by the parent company’s significantly higher annual R&D investment of roughly $2 billion, or 3–4% of its revenue. This collaboration supports faster innovation cycles and helps the company consistently refresh its product portfolio. In addition, LGEIL benefits from access to advanced manufacturing technologies and technical know-how, as well as allocation of global exports.The company’s extensive in-house manufacturing footprint, with nearly 95% of products manufactured internally at its Noida and Pune facilities, gives the company strong control over its supply chain while delivering meaningful scale efficiencies. Further strengthening this advantage, it has announced plans to set up a third manufacturing facility at Sri City in Andhra Pradesh, with a proposed investment of Rs 5,000 crore. The new unit, expected to become operational by FY27E, will initially focus on air conditioners and AC compressors, before expanding into washing machines and refrigerators. Once fully ramped up, the facility is expected to nearly double capacity across key segments and triple AC compressor capacity, reinforcing LGEIL’s long-term",2026-01-22,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/lg-electronics-india-shares-can-rally-another-20-says-jm-financial-after-initiating-coverage-with-buy-check-target-price/articleshow/126776698.cms,neutral,economictimes,,,,1

"Rs 13,000 crore gone! Why Trent shares crashed 8% despite 17% Q3 growth","Trent share pricenosedived up to 8.3% to Rs 4,060.65 on BSE on Tuesday, wiping out Rs 13,000 crore in market value, even as the Tata Group retailer posted a 17% year-on-year revenue jump to Rs 5,220 crore in the December quarter. The bloodbath came as investors punished the Zudio and Westside operator for what analysts called a worrying deceleration in growth momentum.The market's brutal verdict reflects mounting concerns over weakening same-store sales and slowingrevenue per square foot, a critical metric that strips out the boost from aggressive store expansion. Despite adding 48 Zudio stores and 17 Westside outlets during the quarter, the company's ability to generate sales from existing space continues to deteriorate sharply.UBS captured investor anxiety with its blunt assessment: ""No respite from weaker growth trajectory. Q3 weak again at 17%, misses expectations."" The brokerage maintained its Buy rating, but the damage was done as the stock's premium valuation left no room for disappointment.Citi, which has a Sell rating with a target price of Rs 4,350, highlighted the core problem plaguing Trent's performance. Average revenue per square foot declined 15.7% year-on-year, marking the third consecutive quarter of double-digit deterioration. The firm noted that revenue per square foot in the third quarter ""saw an adverse impact from an early festive season while also benefiting from a relatively weak base,"" with growth of just 1.5% compared to 4.9% in the previous quarter.The company's reported standalone revenue growth of 16.9% came in ahead of Citi's estimate of 15.3%, but that marginal beat was entirely driven by store additions rather than improved productivity. Citi pointed out that higher store additions—Zudio opened 48 net new stores versus their estimate of 40, while Westside added 17 against an expectation of 18—led to better-than-expected revenue growth.Live EventsMorgan Stanley, which maintains an Overweight rating with a target of Rs 5,456, noted that",2026-01-22,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/rs-13000-crore-gone-why-trent-shares-crashed-8-despite-17-q3-growth/articleshow/126365711.cms,neutral,economictimes,,,,1

InCred Equities' top picks: 9 largecap stocks with upside potential of up to 38% in 2026,"After a volatile 2025 marked by persistent foreign institutional investor selling, market sentiment has turned optimistic. Looking ahead to 2026, InCred Equities sees selective opportunities emerging within the large cap space. In a recent report, the brokerage has shortlisted 9 blue-chip stocks across multiple sectors that it believes offer attractive value and the potential to deliver returns of up to 38.40% this year. Here’s the full list. With a target price of Rs 4,250 per share, the brokerage implies an upside potential of 38% from current market levels. The quarterly base order inflow run-rate is expected to gradually scale up to Rs 1,800–2,000 crore, supported by sustained transmission and distribution capex across domestic and overseas markets amid rising power demand and the ongoing green energy transition. A healthy order backlog of around Rs 22,300 crore provides visibility comfort. With a price target of Rs 224, the brokerage implies an upside potential of 29.6%. Reconstruction will drive sustained demand in infrastructure & construction (steel, cement, equipment), clean energy and grid modernisation, defence and dual-use manufacturing, and agriculture & logistics infrastructure (ports and transport corridors), say analysts. InCred has a price target of Rs 1,250 per share, an upside of 26.4% from recent levels. Analysts say the company enjoys superior positioning, compared to other NBFCs, on the back of its best-in-class turnaround time, wide customer base, innovative tech platform, exceptional cross mechanism, expanding product suite, and efficient pedigree. The brokerage has a set a target price of Rs 1,500. That’s an upside potential of 20.6% from current levels. Analysts believe Axis Bank remains a key beneficiary of improving system volume growth and more so, the moderation in credit costs over the medium term will aid its profitability. InCred Equities has a target of Rs 1,180, an upside of 19.1% from current levels.

India needs to narrow the insurance protection gap: Swiss Re,"MUMBAI:Natural disasterrisks are rising in the country as more homes, factories and infrastructure are coming up in vulnerable regions, sharply increasing exposure to potential losses,Swiss Resaid in its latest India market report.According to the global reinsurer, India's totalproperty exposureis now estimated at $26-29 trillion. A significant part of this exposure lies in natural catastrophe hotspots-regions where high concentrations of economic assets overlap with risks such as floods, cyclones and earthquakes.A major disaster in these areas could materially slow nationaleconomic growth, the report said.""The protection gap can have a significant impact in terms of large number of losses in assets, as well as the effect on GDP,"" said Amitabha Ray, market head, Swiss Re India. ""So we are basically highlighting that there is a concentration of risk in the country and we need to concentrate on reducing the protection gap overall, as we talk about it in the report, with a particular emphasis on these hotspots.""Swiss Re highlighted that India's total property exposure is now about six to seven times the country's GDP. While this ratio is lower than in advanced economies, disasters can still shave up to 1.3 percentage points off GDP growth in the year they occur. With insurance penetration at just 7-10%, economic losses from a major flood or cyclone could be substantial.Live EventsSwiss Re said Asia's second-largest economy is likely to grow at around 6.5% annually over the next five years, as India remains among the fastest-growing major emerging markets. Swiss Re estimates total insurance premiums in India to grow at a compound annual rate of about 6.9% in real terms between 2026 and 2030, making the country one of the fastest-growing largeinsurance marketsglobally.Swiss Re said India's property risk exposure has risen sharply over recent decades due to rapid economic growth and urbanisation, with assets increasingly concentrated in disaster-prone regions.

"NSE, IGX in talks to launch India's first natural gas futures contract","TheNSEsaid on Thursday it is in discussions with the Indian Gas Exchange to develop and launch an IndianNatural Gas Futurescontract, a move that could mark a significant step in deepening India’s energy and commodity derivatives markets.In a statement, NSE said talks are centred on a strategic collaboration aimed at building a domestic futures contract aligned with India’s evolving natural gas pricing framework. The proposed product is expected to offer market participants a transparent and efficient risk management tool, while also supporting better price discovery in the country’s growing gas market.The initiative seeks to combine NSE’s experience in operating large-scale derivatives markets with IGX’s role in spot natural gas trading and physical market development.IGXcurrently facilitates gas trading across multiple hubs in India and plays a key role in price discovery for domestically traded natural gas.According to NSE, the introduction of Indian Natural Gas Futures is expected to benefit a wide range of participants across the energy value chain.

"BHEL shares rally 5% after hitting lower circuit on China concerns. Should you buy, sell or hold?","Shares ofBharat Heavy Electricalsrebounded sharply on Friday, rising as much as 4.8% to Rs 285.50 on the BSE, a day after the stock plunged 10% and hit the lower circuit.The recovery came as investors reassessed reports that India may ease restrictions onChinese firms biddingfor government contracts. The earlier news had sparked fears of intensifying competition and pressure on pricing and margins for state-run power equipment makers such asBHEL.Despite Friday’s recovery, the stock remains under pressure. BHEL is down about 5% over the past week and has fallen 2.6% so far in 2026.Why the China factor spooked the marketThe selloff was triggered by media reports suggesting that India plans to scrap curbs on Chinese firms bidding for government contracts. These restrictions were introduced in 2020 under the Atmanirbhar Bharat package and subsequent amendments to the General Financial Rules, followingIndia-China border tensions.As part of those measures, bidders from countries sharing a land border with India were required to obtain mandatory political and security clearances, effectively restricting imports from China across sensitive sectors, including power and energy.Live EventsJM Financial: Relief, not risk, for PSUsJM Financial said the removal of restrictions, especially at the component level, could actually benefit public sector undertakings such as BHEL rather than hurt them.“Removal of restrictions at the components level (e.g., CRGO steel) will benefit PSUs like BHEL,” the brokerage said, adding that even a broader easing would have “little impact” given developers’ past experience with Chinese equipment and strong domestic demand within China itself.JM Financial noted that before the restrictions, Indian heavy electrical equipment manufacturers imported large quantities of castings, forgings and pipes from China. After the curbs, they were forced to source from Europe, raising costs and delaying execution due to a limited global supplier base.Under a scenar",2026-01-22,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/bhel-shares-rally-5-after-hitting-lower-circuit-on-china-concerns-should-you-buy-sell-or-hold/articleshow/126427695.cms,neutral,economictimes,,,,1

"Asian stock rally eases as Japan slips, oil falls","Asian stocks, off to their best-ever start to a year, took a breather Wednesday with Japanese equities slipping amid rising tensions with China.TheNikkei 225 Indexfell 0.4% at the open, pushing the MSCI Asia Pacific Index lower after four days of gains. The yen was a touch weaker against the dollar. Contracts also indicated a weaker open for Hong Kong stocks, after the S&P 500 Index added 0.6% to top a closing record hit in late December.Precious metals were mixed with silver rising 1.5%, while gold edged lower. A Bloomberg gauge of the dollar held its gains from the last session. Oil extended losses after President Donald Trump said Venezuela would turn over as many as 50 million barrels of crude to the US.Escalating tensions between Asia’s two largest economies are in focus in the region, even as optimism overartificial intelligenceand expectations of Federal Reserve easing propelled US shares to a new high. Investors have largely shrugged off geopolitical risks, including those tied to Venezuela, extending a three-year bull run fueled by demand for AI-linked shares.“The markets are alive with activity and a lot of it is quite positive,” Kyle Rodda, a senior analyst at Capital.com, wrote in a note. “Wall Street is back around record highs as optimism remains elevated about the investment landscape for the year ahead.”Live EventsChina imposed controls on exports to Japan with potential military uses, escalating tensions between the two countries.All dual-use items are banned from being exported to Japan for military use effective immediately, China’s Ministry of Commerce said in a statement Tuesday.

"Priority sector lending: RBI asks HDFC, ICICI banks to make extra provisions","MUMBAI: The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has flagged deficiencies inpriority sector lending(PSL) compliance at large private lendersHDFC BankandICICI Bank, pointing to significant portions of their agriculture loan portfolios following annual supervisory reviews.The regulator has directed ICICI Bank to make an additional one-time provision of Rs 1,283 crore and HDFC Bank to set aside Rs 500 crore, besides urging both lenders to address gaps in their portfolios to bring them in line with PSL norms. ""In the future, we need to operate in a model that is acceptable to the regulator,"" HDFC Bank chief financial officer Srinivasan Vaidyanathan said during an earnings call. ""The recalibration of our book is driven by the scale of finance, to clearly classify what is genuinely an agriculture loan and what falls outside that remit.""Regulators have been closely scrutinising banks for the over-classification of agricultural loans, particularly where borrowings are partly used for non-farm purposes. The RBI has asked banks to tighten agri loan classification by ensuring that only credit meeting genuine farm requirements-as defined by the official scale of finance-is treated as agricultural lending. Any lending beyond these thresholds is required to be reclassified or managed under non-agri categories.Market participants said the additional provisioning reflects regulatory action rather than asset quality stress. ""The RBI has asked some banks to declassify these loans as PSL, and even though there are no provisioning gaps, this is effectively a punishment in the form of additional capital set aside,"" said Ashutosh Mishra, head of institutional equities research at Ashika Stock Broking. ""Banks have indicated they will rectify documentation gaps and other regulatory formalities so that these loans can be reclassified as agricultural loans in the next cycle.""Live EventsIn ICICI Bank's case, the RBI identified misclassification in the agriculture portfolio amounting to Rs 20,000-25,00",2026-01-22,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/priority-sector-lending-rbi-asks-hdfc-icici-banks-to-make-extra-provisions/articleshow/126665058.cms,neutral,economictimes,,,,1

"Budget may tap oil windfall? JM Financial flags excise-duty risk for HPCL, BPCL, IOCL; backs Oil India, ONGC","With theUnion Budget 2026-27just weeks away and Brent crude hovering near $60 a barrel,JM Financialis urging investors to pick their oil and gas bets carefully. The brokerage has reiterated buy ratings onOil IndiaandONGC, while warning of fiscal risks for state-runoil marketing companies, maintaining a sell onHPCLand reduce calls onIOCLandBPCL, citing potential excise-duty hikes that could offset gains from low crude prices.JM Financial said subdued crude prices could continue to support near-term marketing margins for OMCs but cautioned that the government could use the upcomingBudgetto claw back revenue gains through higher excise duties on petrol and diesel. “OMCs’ blended auto-fuel GMM of ~INR 8.2/ltr (vs. historical GMM of INR 3.5/ltr) implies INR 3-4/ltr scope for a hike in excise duty,” the brokerage noted. “Every INR 1/ltr increase in excise duty can boost central government revenue by INR 165 bn annually.”Upstream stocks stand outFor upstream producers, JM Financial sees significant value at current prices, which already factor in weaker near-term crude realizations. The brokerage reiterated its buy rating on Oil India, with a revised target of Rs 500 per share, and on ONGC, with a revised target of Rs 290 per share, citing medium-term production growth and attractive current valuations.“We prefer Oil India as it could be a ~15% earnings-compounding story over the next 2-3 years,” JM Financial said, citing expected 20-25% cumulative oil and gas production growth and the expansion of the Numaligarh refinery from 3mmtpa to 9mmtpa. ONGC, while less aggressive, is also expected to benefit from medium-term production growth, despite lower near-term Brent assumptions of $65/bbl for FY26 and FY27.Live EventsOverall, JM Financial’s analysis highlights the resilience of upstream producers in a subdued global crude environment, suggesting that investors could find more reliable medium-term growth in Oil India and ONGC compared with downstream marketing and refining c",2026-01-22,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/budget-may-tap-oil-windfall-jm-financial-flags-excise-duty-risk-for-hpcl-bpcl-iocl-backs-oil-india-ongc/articleshow/126407733.cms,neutral,economictimes,,,,1
"India’s new labour codes could wipe out up to a fifth of IT profits, Jefferies warns","India’s $250 billion information technology industry is bracing for a potentially sharp earnings shock from the rollout of the country’s new labour codes, with Jefferies warning that December-quarter profits could fall by as much as 10%–20% and margins could remain under sustained pressure thereafter, even as it reiterates selective buy calls on stocks such asInfosys,HCL Technologies,Coforge,Mphasis,Sagilityand IKS.Jefferies said the consolidation of 29 labour laws into four new codes, effective November 2025, will materially alter how employee compensation and benefits are calculated, forcing IT companies to recognise sharply higher gratuity and leave-encashment liabilities in the December quarter. The brokerage estimates that contributions linked to gratuity, provident fund and leave encashment could rise by 27%–70%, resulting in a one-time hit to profits.“The increase will be recognised as a one-time impact in Dec-25 results,” Jefferies said, adding that the impact at the lower end could still erode 10%–20% of quarterly profits across the sector.Structural rise in employee costsBeyond the one-off adjustment, Jefferies warned of a structural increase in employee costs. Under the new wage code, “wages” will become the base for calculating statutory benefits and must account for at least 50% of an employee’s cost-to-company, compared with roughly 30%–40% under the current regime. Companies will also have to allow annual encashment of leave exceeding 30 days and extend gratuity benefits to fixed-term employees after one year, instead of five.Live EventsAs a result, the brokerage estimates that in-hand salaries could fall by 4%–6% if firms continue to contribute 12% of wages to provident fund. While companies may opt for a lower statutory PF contribution of Rs21,600 a year, Jefferies cautioned that this may not fully offset the pressure, particularly at junior levels.Citing an Aon survey, Jefferies noted that about two-thirds of IT firms expect employee costs to rise",2026-01-22,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/indias-new-labour-codes-could-wipe-out-up-to-a-fifth-of-it-profits-jefferies-warns/articleshow/126501714.cms,neutral,economictimes,,,,1

Ahead of Market: 10 things that will decide stock market action on Tuesday,"The Indian market ended lower on Monday, with the Sensex and Nifty pulling back as global trade-war rhetoric returned to the headlines and heavyweight earnings disappointed at home. The BSE Sensex slid as much as 629 points intraday on Monday, touching a low of 82,941.01, while the NSE Nifty 50 fell 0.7% to an intraday low of 25,504.85.At the end of the day, the Sensex was down about 324 points, or 0.39%, at 83,246.18, while the Nifty shed 109 points, or 0.42%, to 25,585.50, as risk appetite waned.Here's how analysts read the market pulse:Global risk appetite weakened after U.S. President Donald Trump announced new tariff threats against eight European nations, reigniting concerns of a potential U.S.–EU trade dispute, said Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Investments, adding that this development triggered a broad risk‑off mood across global equity markets, prompting investors to rotate toward safe‑haven assets like gold.“Meanwhile, select Asian markets, especially China, displayed relative resilience, supported by favourable macro indicators and stronger‑than‑expected export‑driven GDP growth. Domestically, sentiment remains cautious amid ongoing FII outflows. With the Q3 earnings season progressing, stock‑specific volatility is likely, particularly where performance has been mixed. Overall, given the blend of global uncertainty and domestic triggers, markets are expected to remain in a consolidation zone,"" said Nair.Also read |5 Wall Street moguls who dismissed Bitcoin as a fad — Guess what they’re saying now!Live EventsUS marketsUS markets were shut on January 19 as the country observed Martin Luther King Jr Day.European MarketsIn Europe, the STOXX 600 index fell 1.2%.

Bajaj Finserv completes acquisition of Allianz stake in insurance JVs,"Mumbai:Bajaj Finservand its promoter group companies have acquired a combined 97% stake inBajaj AllianzGeneral Insurance and BajajAllianzLife Insurance from Allianz SE, ending a two-decade partnership with the German insurer, according to a stock exchange filing.The acquisitions were carried out under share purchase agreements signed on March 17, 2025, and later amended.Bajaj Finservsaid it bought about 1.11 million shares of Bajaj Allianz General Insurance and 1.52 million shares of Bajaj Allianz Life Insurance from Allianz.

Together, the promoter entities now hold 97% of both insurance companies.Following the change in shareholding, the joint venture agreements between Bajaj Finserv and Allianz were terminated with effect from Thursday.Allianz continues to hold the remaining 3% stake, which is expected to be bought out through a share buyback. The boards of Bajaj Allianz General and Bajaj Allianz Life have approved proposals to buy back shares at the same price paid in the earlier transactions, subject to regulatory approvals.

What Tiger Global ruling means for foreign investors,"A recent Supreme Court ruling in the Tiger Global-Flipkart share sale case has brought India's tax treaties back into focus. Here's a look at what it means for foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) and private equity (PE) funds.What did the court actually rule?The Supreme Court ruled that foreign investors cannot rely solely on a Tax Residency Certificate (TRC) to claim tax benefits under aDouble Taxation Avoidance Agreement(DTAA). The court held that tax authorities are entitled to examine thecommercial substanceof overseas investment structures while assessing treaty claims.The ruling also clarified that such examination is not barred merely because the investment was made before April 1, 2017 - the date from which India's General Anti-Avoidance Rules (GAAR) formally came into force.What do terms like DTAA, commercial substance and GAAR mean?DTAA (Double Taxation Avoidance Agreement) is a tax treaty between two countries that decides which country can tax an investor's income and prevents the same income from being taxed twice.Live EventsCommercial substance means that an investment structure has real business activity in the country where it claims tax residence, such as employees or operations, and has not been set up only to claim tax benefits.GAAR (General Anti-Avoidance Rule) allows the Indian tax department to deny tax benefits if a structure is created mainly to avoid tax and lacks commercial substance.What does this SC ruling change?The ruling changes the long-held comfort that possession of a valid TRC by itself is sufficient to secure treaty benefits. The court made it clear that a TRC is necessary but treaty protection can be denied if the underlying structure does not show commercial substance.What does this mean for FPIs? Who could be impacted now?The ruling has implications for private equity exits routed through Mauritius, Singapore and Cyprus, which have historically been the preferred routes for several foreign entities to invest in India. This is pa",2026-01-22,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/what-tiger-global-ruling-means-for-foreign-investors/articleshow/126665134.cms,neutral,economictimes,,,,1

"Brokerages initiate coverage on Meesho, Groww, Angel One, 8 other stocks this week. How many do you have?","A host of domestic and global brokerages have initiated coverage on select Indian stocks across sectors such as broking, insurance and hospitality. Analysts are bullish on major names such as Groww, Angel One, Meesho and forecast an upside of up to 51% from current market levels. Here is a list of 11 stocks on which brokerages initiated coverage this week. Brokerage: Morgan StanleyRating: Equal-weightTarget Price: Rs 169Morgan Stanley initiated coverage on newly listed Meesho with an Equal-weight rating, flagging that valuations appear full after the stock’s strong post-listing run-up. The brokerage notes that Meesho’s advertising business is still at an early stage of monetisation, while the company remains focused on rapid user expansion. As a result, Morgan Stanley believes steady-state profitability is still a few years away, with the target price implying about 2.5% upside from current levels. Brokerage: NomuraRating: BuyTarget Price: Rs 1,650Nomura has initiated coverage on United Spirits with a Buy rating, describing the company as being at the cusp of a developing upcycle. Despite the stock declining 7% so far this year, the brokerage sees a turnaround underway. Nomura’s target price implies an upside potential of 24.5% from current market levels. Brokerage: InvestecRating: BuyTarget Price: Rs 675Investec implies an upside of 42% from current market levels.

Mukul Agrawal’s newest stock bet is up 10% in just 2 sessions. Do you own?,"Ace investorMukul Agrawalhas addedHindustan Construction Company(HCC) to his Rs 6,500-crore portfolio, acquiring a 1.68% stake through the purchase of 4.40 crore shares, according to BSE shareholding data. The stock has rallied nearly 10% over the past two trading sessions and climbed as much as 7% in today’s trade.The market veteran, founder of Param Capital Group with over two decades of capital market experience, made the entry after a sharp correction in the stock, which has fallen over 30% over the past year. Despite the recent decline, the stock has delivered returns of more than 170% over the last five years. The company has executed several large infrastructure projects across India and operates in the transportation, power, and water segments. Trendlyne data shows that the investment is currently valued at Rs 86 crore.Despite pressure on smallcap stocks for most of 2025, Agrawal’s portfolio featured five multibagger names during the year, namely– Oseal Devices, Zelio E-Mobility,Monolithisch India,Zota Health Care, and ASM Technologies.As for HCC, the company said last month that its rights issue was subscribed 200%, with applications amounting to around Rs 2,008 crore against an issue size of Rs 1,000 crore. The company retained proceeds equivalent to the issue size, while the excess subscription amount will be refunded to investors in line with applicable regulations.Commenting on the successful completion, Vice Chairman and Managing Director Arjun Dhawan said the strong response would help strengthen HCC’s balance sheet, aid ongoing deleveraging efforts, and support the company’s long-term growth strategy.Live EventsIn a separate development last month, the company secured a major infrastructure contract worth around Rs 901 crore from the Northeast Frontier Railway (NFR). The project involves the construction of a 3.5-kilometre main tunnel and includes end-to-end design, engineering, and commissioning services.

"‘India’s biggest startup-investment window is now open despite pessimism,’ says Zerodha CEO Nithin Kamath","At a time when markets are preoccupied with earnings volatility and geopolitical risk, Zerodha founder and CEO Nithin Kamath said investors and entrepreneurs are overlooking a larger, more enduring opportunity.In a post on social media platform X onNational Startup Day, Kamath argued that despite widespread pessimism about India’s growth prospects, the country is entering its most powerful phase yet for building companies, one shaped by deep domestic capital, policy support and technology that has radically lowered the cost of ambition.""There's a lot of pessimism about India's growth prospects right now, amplified by the sheer amount of geopolitical drama we're living through. But if we aren't hopeful that India will do better, then everything becomes moot,"" Kamath wrote on X.Kamath recognised the headwinds facing the broader economy. ""This isn't to say we don't have real problems. We do. But every successful country has had to deal with its own share of thorny challenges along its development path. What matters is how we respond,"" he said.Marking National Startup Day as a moment for introspection, Kamath said that despite near-term uncertainties, the broader environment remains favourable for entrepreneurs. ""I can't think of a better time to build something in India, and for the world, despite all the challenges,"" he added.Live EventsRecalling the mid-2010s, Kamath noted that India’s startup ecosystem was far less developed and widely accepted at the time. “If I were tweeting this in 2015–16, the startup landscape barely extended beyond a handful of large e-commerce firms,” he said. Back then, he pointed out, there were no substantial domestic funding pools, limited institutional support, and a prevailing perception that startups were not a viable career option.That landscape, Kamath argued, has since changed fundamentally. ""Today, everything has changed,"" he wrote, pointing to deeper pools of domestic capital, particularly long-term investors, an improving ease of",2026-01-22,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/indias-biggest-startup-investment-window-is-now-open-despite-pessimism-says-zerodha-ceo-nithin-kamath/articleshow/126562422.cms,neutral,economictimes,,,,1

From RIL to TCS: Stocks that moved market value for India's top 10 conglomerates in 2025,"The year 2025 turned out to be a mixed one for India's biggest business houses. A look at the top 10 conglomerates shows that groups such as Reliance, HDFC, Adani, Bajaj and Aditya Birla ended the year with sizable gains, driven by a handful of large stocks that attracted strong investor interest. In contrast, the Tata Group and Godrej Group saw meaningful erosion in market value, as steep declines in a few heavyweight companies overwhelmed gains elsewhere.Reliance Group: One stock did all the heavy liftingMukesh Ambani-led Reliance emerged as the biggest wealth creator among large groups in absolute terms. The group's total market cap rose by about Rs 4.65 lakh crore during the year. Almost the entire gain came fromReliance Industries, which alone added nearly Rs 4.79 lakh crore in value.The gain was on the back of a rare alignment of positive triggers across telecom, energy and consumer businesses. Reliance Jio regained momentum after a dull 2024, and brokerages turned more bullish, with expectations of steady revenue and profit growth.That said, most other Reliance group stocks lost value. Network18 (-Rs 4,319 crore), Just Dial (-Rs 2282 crore), Alok Industries and cable companies like Hathway (-Rs 2.74 crore) and Den Networks (-Rs 597 crore) all ended the year lower. Jio Financial Services, with a net market value loss of Rs 2,414 crore, also slipped slightly. Still, the sheer size of Reliance Industries ensured the group finished firmly in the green.Adani Group: Ports and power shineThe Adani Group added around Rs 1.4 lakh crore in market value in 2025. The biggest contributors were Adani Ports (Rs 73,107 crore) and Adani Power (Rs 71,681 crore), which together added nearly Rs 1.45 lakh crore. Strong cargo volumes, better pricing and infrastructure spending supported Adani Ports, while Adani Power benefited from improved demand and operating performance.Live EventsAdani Energy Solutions also added about Rs 26,770 crore market value to the group in 2025.

RBI proposes to cap banks' dividend payout at 75% of PAT,"Kolkata: TheReserve Bank of India(RBI) Tuesday proposed to raise the dividend payout cap for banks to 75% of the net profit from the earlier 40% rule. It also wants bank boards to oversee the asset quality and provisioning gaps, capital projection and long-term growth plans before declaring a dividend.The regulator has laid down a graded structure of dividend payment based on banks' common equity tier 1 (CET1) capital levels in a draft proposal and inviting comments on it by February 5.Stronger banks with more than 20% CET1 would be allowed to pay 100% of adjusted net profit, which will be the net profit minus net non-performing assets for the dividend payment year, the regulator said in a statement on its website. This would, however, be subject to the75% dividend payout limit.Systemically important banks -State Bank of India(SBI),HDFC BankandICICI Bank- would need to have even stronger CET1 ratios if they plan to pay 100% dividend of their adjusted net profit.For instance, SBI would need a minimum 20.8% CET1 ratio for this, while the minimum CET1 ratios HDFC Bank and ICICI Bank would be 20.4% and 20.2%, respectively, showed the calculations by the regulator/analysts.Live EventsMeanwhile, banks with less than 8% CET1 would not be permitted to declare dividends at all.These directions shall come into force from the financial year 2026-27, the RBI said.To be sure, banks -- both Indian and those of foreign origin operating locally in a branch mode -- need to be profitable and should meet the minimum capital adequacy norm to declare dividends.Foreign banks operating in India in the branch mode can remit dividends or surplus without prior approval of the RBI. However, if excess remittance is found on audit, the head office of that foreign bank needs to return the excess remittance and make good the shortfall, the regulator said.For local banks too, overstatement of profit would need deduction. In case the net profit includes any exceptional or extraordinary income, or i",2026-01-22,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/rbi-proposes-to-cap-banks-dividend-payout-at-75-of-pat/articleshow/126384592.cms,neutral,economictimes,,,,1

"Stock Market Holiday 2026: Are BSE, NSE closed for Maharashtra municipal elections?","The Indian stock market will remain closed for trading on January 15 following municipal corporation elections in Maharashtra. Both the BSE and NSE have issued revised circulars confirming that there will be no trading across segments tomorrow.In a circular, the BSE said trading in the equity segment, equity derivatives, commodity derivatives and electronic gold receipts will stay shut on January 15. It also clarified that equity derivatives contracts originally scheduled to expire on January 15, 2026 will now expire a day earlier on January 14, 2026, and that these changes will be reflected in the end-of-day contract master files. The NSE, too, has updated its earlier communication to declare January 15 a trading holiday in the capital market as well as the F&O segment.This marks a change from last week, when both exchanges had only classified January 15 as a settlement holiday, which had suggested that trading would continue as usual. Settlement holidays are usually announced during elections or major public events when banking and clearing operations are disrupted. Since January 15 is a public holiday in Maharashtra, most banks are expected to remain closed, prompting the exchanges to revise their stance.Stock market holidays in 2026With the latest addition, Indian stock exchanges will now observe 16 trading holidays in 2026, excluding weekends. January 26 will be the second market holiday of the month.Live EventsLooking ahead, key closures in the first half of the year include Holi on March 3, Ram Navami on March 26, Mahavir Jayanti on March 31 and Good Friday on April 3.

RIL shares in spotlight as firm evaluates Venezuelan crude purchases,"Shares ofReliance Industries(RIL) are expected to be in the spotlight on Friday, January 9, after the company indicated it would consider purchasingVenezuelan crude oilif allowed underUS regulations.Reliance, which operates the world’s largest refining complex, said it is awaiting clarity on whether Venezuelan oil will be accessible to non-US buyers and confirmed it would pursue purchases in a compliant manner once regulatory permission is clear.The statement follows a significant shift in US–Venezuelan energy dynamics, with Caracas and Washington reaching an agreement this week to export up to $2 billion worth of Venezuelan crude — an estimated 30-50 million barrels — to the United States.If restrictions are eased for non-US entities, Indian refiners could potentially resume or expand imports of Venezuelan crude, which had largely fallen off India’s crude import list due to previous sanctions and tariff barriers.Reliance had halted Venezuelan oil purchases in March 2025 after the US imposed a 25% tariff oncrude importsfrom Venezuela, with its last shipment received in May 2025.Live EventsThe company operates two large refinery complexes in Gujarat with a combined capacity of about 1.4 million barrels per day, facilities well-suited to process heavier crude grades such as Venezuela’s Merey blend.Other Indian refiners, includingIndian Oil Corporation(IOC) andHindustan PetroleumCorp (HPCL), are also expected to evaluate Venezuelan crude imports if non-US entities are permitted to participate in such transactions.Analysts say that the return of Venezuelan barrels to global markets could come at discounted prices, enhancing feedstock optionality and potentially improvingrefining marginsfor compatible refiners.Additionally, Venezuelan crude may present a politically safer alternative to Russian oil, especially amid rising scrutiny of Russian energy trade linked to the war in Ukraine.

$25 million paycheck! Berkshire's new CEO Greg Abel will earn more than Warren Buffett ever did in salary,"Berkshire Hathawayhas raised the annual salary of its new chief executiveGreg Abelto $25 million, a sharp jump from the $100,000 salary thatWarren Buffettchose to draw for more than four decades while running the company, according to a Reuters report.The pay revision comes days after Buffett formally stepped down from day-to-day leadership at the end of December. Abel, 63, took over as chief executive on January 1, marking the first change at the top of Berkshire in more than 60 years.Buffett, now 95, has retired from operational responsibilities but will continue as chairman and remain involved with the company.Abel had spent the past eight years as vice chairman in charge of Berkshire’s non-insurance businesses and was long seen as Buffett’s chosen successor. His compensation during that period was also set by Buffett. In 2024, Abel earned a salary of $21 million, following $20 million in 2023. In 2022, he received a $16 million salary along with a $3 million bonus.Buffett had approved identical pay packages for Vice Chairman Ajit Jain, who oversees Berkshire’s insurance operations, between 2022 and 2024. The company has not yet disclosed the compensation details for Abel and Jain for 2025.Live EventsBuffett led Omaha-based Berkshire Hathaway for more than six decades, transforming it from a struggling textile business into a diversified conglomerate now valued at over $1 trillion. Today, Berkshire owns or controls nearly 200 businesses spanning insurance, railroads, energy, manufacturing and retail.Its major assets include Geico car insurance, the BNSF railroad, a vast utilities network, and well-known consumer brands such as See’s Candies and Brooks running shoes.Despite stepping away from daily management, Buffett remains one of the world’s richest individuals and continues as Berkshire’s chairman. During his tenure, the company repeatedly noted in regulatory filings that its executive compensation philosophy was ""different"" from that of most public companies,",2026-01-22,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/25-million-paycheck-berkshires-new-ceo-greg-abel-will-earn-more-than-warren-buffett-ever-did-in-salary/articleshow/126464644.cms,neutral,economictimes,,,,1

"Market Trading Guide: Buy Ashok Leyland, Polycab India and 2 more stocks on Tuesday for up to 12% upside","Nifty ended with cuts on Monday, dragged by heavyweights like Reliance Industries (RIL) and ICICI Bank following their Q3 earnings. The index remained under bearish control, sustaining below the 20 EMA throughout the session. Commenting on the day's action, Rupak De, Senior Technical Analyst at LKP Securities said the day was marked by volatility, and every rise was sold into. ""The RSI continued in a bearish crossover and trended lower as the index closed at a multi-day low. Market fear remained elevated, as reflected by a spike in India VIX. In the near term, the index may continue to drift lower, with a potential downside target around 25,200, while resistance is placed near 25,700,"" De said. Here are 4 stock recommendations for Tuesday: Stop Loss: Rs 7,017Target: Rs 7,995POLYCAB is showing signs of a bullish reversal after correcting within a falling channel and forming a higher low near the Rs 7,000–7,100 support zone. The recent rebound with a strong bullish candle indicates renewed buying interest. A sustained move above Rs 7,500 can accelerate momentum toward the upper channel resistance near Rs 7,900–8,000. The broader trend remains constructive as long as price holds above key support. Traders can consider fresh longs at CMP Rs 7,415 with a stop-loss at Rs 7,017 and a target of Rs7,995, aligning with the next major resistance zone and the channel breakout projection. (Kunal Kamble, Sr. Technical Research Analyst, Bonanza) Stop Loss: Rs 265Target: Rs 306Federal Bank has broken out strongly from its recent consolidation zone with a sharp bullish candle supported by rising volume, indicating renewed momentum. The price is trading above key moving averages (20, 50, 200 SMA), confirming a continuation of the uptrend. RSI near 68 reflects strong but sustainable momentum without overbought stress. A sustained hold above Rs275 strengthens the breakout structure and opens room for an upward move toward Rs300–306. Dips toward the 20-EMA are likely to attract buyers.",2026-01-22,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/market-trading-guide-buy-ashok-leyland-polycab-india-and-2-more-stocks-on-tuesday-for-up-to-12-upside/slideshow/126690358.cms,neutral,economictimes,,,,1

Bad start to 2026 as Rs 9 lakh crore lost in 5 days. What should stock market investors do?,"Indian equity markets had the worst possible start to the new year as selling pressure intensified through the week, wiping out confidence of any stability that market participants had entering into the year. The Sensex fell another 600 points on Friday, taking the total decline to over 2,000 points across all five trading sessions of the week. In value terms, investors lost more than Rs 9 lakh crore, marking one of the most unsettling starts to a calendar year in recent memory.The sharp correction came at a time when investors were hoping for stability after months of volatility. Instead, global uncertainty, rising geopolitical risks and renewed trade tensions combined to deliver what market participants described as a ""risk-off"" phase across Dalal Street.Trump tariffs weigh heavily on sentimentThe dominant trigger behind the sustained selloff was renewed tariff-related rhetoric from US President Donald Trump. Markets have remained under pressure since Trump signalled that tariffs on Indian goods could be raised over India’s continued purchases of Russian crude oil.The situation worsened after the US also hinted at imposing punitive 500% tariffs on countries importing Russian oil, rekindling fears of a major disruption to global trade flows.The India-US trade relationship has come sharply into focus as negotiations on a bilateral trade agreement remain unresolved despite six rounds of talks since March. Adding to the uncertainty, US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick recently claimed that the deal stalled due to a lack of direct engagement between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Trump. The Trump administration has already imposed tariffs of up to 50% on Indian goods, among the highest levied on any country.Live EventsThese developments have kept investors on edge, with emerging markets like India bearing the brunt of global risk aversion.US Supreme Court verdict on Trump tariff tonight: How Sensex, Nifty may get impactedForeign investors continue to sellSustained f",2026-01-22,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/bad-start-to-2026-as-rs-9-lakh-crore-lost-in-5-days-what-should-stock-market-investors-do/articleshow/126434430.cms,neutral,economictimes,,,,1
Trent shares sink 8% after Q3 business update misses Street estimates,"Trent share pricedeclined sharply by 8.3% in early trade on Tuesday, January 6, hitting an intraday low of Rs 4,060.65 on the BSE, even after the Tata Group’s retail arm reported a 17% year-on-year (YoY) increase in standalone revenue for the December 2025 quarter.The company reported revenue of Rs 5,220 crore for the third quarter, supported by continued traction in its value-fashion and lifestyle segments despite a mixed consumption environment.While the pace of growth has moderated compared to the sharp expansion seen in recent years, Trent maintained steady performance during the quarter. As of December 2025, the company operated 1,164 stores across its portfolio, including 278 Westside outlets and 854 Zudio stores. Of the Zudio outlets, four are located in the UAE, indicating the brand’s early steps in international markets.Zudio remains the primary growth driver for the company, fuelled by its positioning in the affordable fashion segment and its rapid rollout across newer geographies.Over the past 18 months, Zudio has reshaped Trent’s store mix and expanded its geographic footprint significantly. On the other hand, Westside, the company’s more established premium fashion brand, has seen relatively slower momentum, although it continues to contribute meaningfully to the overall topline.Live EventsSensex, Nifty today: Catch all the LIVE stock market action hereTrent share price historyOver the last one year, the stock has declined by 39.38%, reflecting a sharp correction.

Vodafone Idea AGR relief offers breathing room but shareholders still await clarity,"Vodafone Idea(VIL) may have received a temporary lifeline with the Department of Telecommunications’ recent decision to defer its AGR (Adjusted Gross Revenue) dues for four years, but for shareholders, the outlook remains far from reassuring.With no immediate boost in earnings visibility and capital infusion still elusive, analysts say investors must temper their expectations.In its latest update, the DoT acknowledged VIL’s request to convert interest on AGR dues into equity and confirmed that the final amount for conversion will be determined once audited figures are submitted. Until then, the company has been granted a four-year moratorium on its AGR payments, a move that alleviates near-term cash flow pressure, but does not address the telecom player’s underlying structural issues.According to domestic brokerage firm Motilal Oswal Financial Services, while the deferment may help preserve cash, Vodafone Idea continues to face formidable hurdles: a Rs 2.2 trillion debt burden, high annual payouts to the government (~Rs 400 billion in spectrum and AGR obligations), and rising network costs.Motilal Oswal notes that ""AGR dues of Rs 4,390 crore are only deferred, not written off"", and these will have to be paid eventually.Live EventsAnother brokerage firm,JM Financial, echoes this, stating that the company now has breathing room to focus on operational improvements and network investments. However, the firm also reiterates that this relief does not eliminate the liability, and investors should temper expectations of a full revival based on this relief alone.Despite marginal growth in ARPU (average revenue per user) and flat EBITDA, the brokerage highlights that cash losses are persisting, and subscriber churn continues.Most critically, VIL’s 5G rollout remains on paper. The operator hasn’t made any visible headway on monetizing the 5G spectrum it holds, and the need for a sizeable capital raise, likely upwards of Rs 250 billion, remains unfulfilled.While promoters have",2026-01-22,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/vodafone-idea-agr-relief-offers-breathing-room-but-shareholders-still-await-clarity/articleshow/126480295.cms,neutral,economictimes,,,,1

Ola Electric shares extend rally for a fourth session on turnaround hopes; up 27% in early 2026,"Shares ofOla Electric Mobilitycontinued their upward momentum on Tuesday, rising as much as 4.4% to Rs 45.87 on the NSE. The stock has now advanced for the fourth straight trading session, gaining nearly 27% in the first four trading days of 2026, as investors responded positively to signs of operational and demand recovery.The rally follows a January 1 disclosure by the company to the BSE, in which Ola Electric said it had begun to see a business turnaround in December 2025, driven by improvements in its service operations under a new initiative called “Hyperservice.”Ola Electric registered 9,020 vehicle units in December 2025, as per VAHAN data. This helped its monthly market share rise to 9.3% in December from 7.2% in November. More notably, during the second half of December, market share climbed to nearly 12%, pointing to a sharp pickup in demand toward the end of the month.On the back of this improvement, Ola Electric re-entered the top three electric two-wheeler players in nearly a dozen states, including major EV markets such as Tamil Nadu, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Jharkhand, Punjab, and Haryana.Ola Electric said it rolled out theHyperservice programto address service challenges that emerged during rapid expansion, which had impacted customer experience and demand. The initiative focuses on clearing service backlogs, expanding and training the workforce, improving spare parts availability, and enabling customer self-service. As a result, 77% of service requests were resolved on the same day in December 2025, reflecting faster turnaround times.Live EventsThe program includes a 250-member rapid-response service team, plans to add over 1,000 service staff, a strengthened spare parts supply chain, and a direct-to-consumer genuine parts platform that has seen more than 8,000 orders since October 2025.Commenting on the developments, Bhavish Aggarwal, Chairman and Managing Director of Ola Electric, said the company’s focus has been on fixing service fundamentals with",2026-01-22,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/ola-electric-shares-extend-rally-for-a-fourth-session-on-turnaround-hopes-up-27-in-early-2026/articleshow/126366419.cms,neutral,economictimes,,,,1

F&O Radar | Laurus Labs signals strong bullish trend; how to play the upside,"Shares ofLaurus Labswere trading near Rs 1,128.50, extending their strong bullish momentum. The stock has recorded a new all-time high at Rs 1,141 and continues to maintain a higher-high, higher-low price structure, underscoring the strength of the ongoing uptrend.“A breakout above the recent swing high of Rs 1,119 further reinforces the bullish sentiment,” said Aakash Shah, Research & Derivatives Analyst at Choice Broking. Meanwhile, the stock remains well above its 20-day, 50-day, and 200-day exponential moving averages (EMAs), signaling strength across short-, medium-, and long-term timeframes.With the Relative Strength Index (RSI) at 78.29 and climbing, buying momentum remains strong, even as the indicator flags near-term overbought conditions.Shah further noted that the immediate resistance is placed at Rs 1,150. ""A decisive breakout above this level, supported by strong volumes, could trigger the next leg of the rally, potentially driving the stock toward Rs 1,233. On the downside, immediate support is seen at Rs 1,092,” he added.With this, Aakash Shah suggests that traders may consider initiating long positions around Rs 1,128.50, with a stop loss at Rs 1,076 and an upside target of Rs 1,233. To play this move, he recommends aBull Call Spreadstrategy in Laurus Labs shares.Live EventsBull Call SpreadTraders may consider deploying a bull call spread to capitalize on a potential market rebound. The strategy involves buying and selling call options with the same expiry but at different strike prices. The purchased call is typically in-the-money (ITM) or at-the-money (ATM), while the sold call is out-of-the-money (OTM). This strategy results in a net debit for the trader, as the cost of the ITM/ATM call is partially offset by the cash flow generated from shorting the OTM call.ETMarkets.com(Prices as of January 7)(Disclaimer: Recommendations, suggestions, views and opinions given by the experts are their own.

Monopoly business: 5 reasons why SBI Securities says subscribe to Bharat Coking Coal IPO,"Bharat Coking Coal Limited (BCCL),Coal India’s coking coal arm, is heading to the market with a Rs 1,071 crore IPO at a time when domestic steel demand remains resilient and India continues to grapple with a structural shortage of coking coal.The IPO, priced in the Rs 21 to 23 range, opens on January 9 and closes on January 13. At the upper end of the band, BCCL will command a post-issue market capitalisation of about Rs 10,711 crore. The issue is entirely an offer for sale by promoter Coal India, which will pare its stake to 90% from 100%.Here are five reasons whySBISecurities says subscribe to theBharat Coking Coal IPO.1)BCCL is India’s largest producer of coking coal and the country’s only meaningful source of prime coking coal. As of April 2024, it held estimated reserves of around 7.91 billion tonnes, accounting for roughly 21.5% of India’s coking coal resources.2)In FY25, the company contributed nearly 58.5% of domestic coking coal production, operating 34 mines across Jharkhand and West Bengal, according to the offer documents.Live EventsBrokerage SBI Securities says the company’s strategic importance stems from India’s widening coking coal demand supply gap, driven by rising steel capacity.“BCCL’s dominant reserve position and parentage under Coal India provide it with operational scale, logistical advantages and access to capital and technical expertise,” it said while recommending a subscribe for the IPO.3)A key growth lever is capacity expansion in coal beneficiation. BCCL currently operates washeries with an owned capacity of 13.65 million tonnes per annum and is in the process of adding three new washeries with a combined capacity of 7 million tonnes per annum, along with the renovation of the Moonidih washery. Once completed, total washery capacity is expected to rise to 20.65 million tonnes per annum, improving realisations and product mix over time.4)Financially, BCCL has delivered sharp margin expansion over the past two years, aided by operating le",2026-01-22,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/monopoly-business-5-reasons-why-sbi-securities-says-subscribe-to-bharat-coking-coal-ipo/articleshow/126389444.cms,neutral,economictimes,,,,1

"IT earnings recovery not quite made to order, but seen on track","ET Intelligence Group: The BSE Infotech index has budged little — a gain of 0.4% — since January 12 whenTata Consultancy Services(TCS), the country’s largest IT company, kicked off the latest result season for the sector. This is despite strong order bookings reported by the top five sector companies, includingTCS,Infosys,HCLTech,WiproandTech Mahindra(TechM). The index has lost nearly 4% over the past month and around 11% over the past 12 months, reflecting the sombre mood among investors amid delays in project execution, which has slowed the revenue growth.Analysts expect gradual recovery over the next few quarters amid large deal ramp ups and rising collaborations of Indian software exporters with global technology partners that is likely to help them take advantage of the increasing artificial intelligence (AI) related opportunities.ET BureauFor the top five software exporters, the aggregate year-on-year incremental revenue on trailing 12 months (TTM) basis has been falling though the momentum in deal wins has remained intact. This reflects the slower execution of projects as clients take more time to decide on the business priorities in a fast-changing technological landscape. ₹The aggregate new deals won by the top five companies were at a three-quarter high of $21.5 billion in the December quarter, implying 13% growth form the year-ago quarter.In the first nine months of FY26, these companies booked orders worth $63.5 billion based on the reported quarterly total contract value (TCV), showing a year-on-year growth of 16.3%. IF the sample companies can maintain the pace of deal bookings in the fourth and final quarter of the fiscal year then the TCV for FY26 may surpass the previous year’s tally of $77.1 billion.Live EventsWhat has spooked investors, however, is that the strong TCV traction has not yet resulted in accelerated top line growth. The incremental TTM revenue for the sample fell to $1.1 billion in the December 2025 quarter from $1.9 billion in the ye",2026-01-22,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/it-earnings-recovery-not-quite-made-to-order-but-seen-on-track/articleshow/126903785.cms,neutral,economictimes,,,,1

"Wipro shares crash 9.5%, brokerages see downside till Rs 220. What should investors do?","Shares of Bengaluru-based IT majorWiprofell up to 9.5% to the day's low of Rs 241.75 on BSE after delivering mixed Q3 print and giving a subdued growth outlook for Q4. Global brokerage firm Jefferies gave one of the lowest target prices of Rs 220 on the stock with an underperform rating.Wipro reported 3Q IT Services revenue of $2.6 billion, up 1.4% QoQ in constant currency terms but guided for 0-2% QoQ revenue growth in CC for Q4, including a 150 bps contribution from the Harman acquisition.""We tweak our FY26-28 EPS estimates and expect Wipro to deliver ~2% EPS CAGR over FY26-28E. Limited earnings growth requires higher dividend yields (7-8%+) to make Wipro's stock an attractive investment. With dividend yield at 3%, the stock should de-rate, inour view. We maintain our UPF rating with a rolled-over PT of Rs220/share based on 17x PE,"" Jefferies said in a note.The Q4 guidance, which was below expectations, factoring in fewer working days, two months of incremental contribution from Harman DTS, and delays in ramp-up of a few large deals, spoiled Dalal Street's mood.Live Events""Management highlighted that some large deals are experiencing delayed ramp-ups due to which its 4QFY26 growth guidance has been set as 0-2%.

"UBS cuts EBITDA estimates for Eternal, Swiggy for next 2-3 years. Here's why","UBS has cut adjusted EBITDA estimates forEternal(Zomato) by 10-18% and forSwiggyby 12-28% for the next two to three fiscal years, citing intensifying competition in India's quick commerce sector that is delaying margin recovery. The analyst revisions mark a significant challenge for both platforms as they battle for market share in a segment characterized by increasingly aggressive discounting.The deterioration in margin outlook stems from a notable intensification in competitive pressure that has persisted since September 2025 and continues into January 2026. UBS's pricing tracker shows discounts have widened by 200-300 basis points compared to September levels and have further increased in January 2026 versus November 2025.Amazon and Zepto have emerged as the most aggressive discounters among online platforms, offering the highest promotional incentives while Blinkit continues to maintain relatively lower discount levels, though still elevated compared to earlier periods. This competitive dynamic reflects the intense battle for market share in India's quick commerce space, where customer acquisition through aggressive pricing has become a standard strategy.Margin Recovery Timeline ExtendedThe most significant impact of UBS's downward revision is the pushback in when the sector achieves sustainable margin improvement. For Eternal's Blinkit division, UBS forecasts the quick commerce unit to reach breakeven in FY27 (versus FY26 previously), a critical inflection point that has now been delayed by a fiscal year. Similarly, for Swiggy's Instamart, margin trajectory has deteriorated substantially, with adjusted EBITDA margins down 120-130 basis points during FY27-FY30.The margin pressure reflects the reality that despite continued network expansion and category expansion helping to grow the overall addressable market, the sector's profitability improvement remains elusive in the near term.Live EventsUBS's analysis notes that while newer platform entries and category exp",2026-01-22,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/ubs-cuts-ebitda-estimates-for-eternal-swiggy-for-next-2-3-years-heres-why/articleshow/126524810.cms,neutral,economictimes,,,,1

Reliance Industries loses $15 billion market cap in bruising start to 2026,"Reliance Industries Ltd. is off to bruising start to the year, with shares down more than 6% as investors digest weak retail outlooks and tougher US rhetoric on India’sRussian oilpurchases — putting the onus on upcoming earnings to arrest the slide.The selloff so far this year has wiped about $15 billion off the company’s market value, making it one of the stock’s worst starts to a year in recent memory and weighing on India’s benchmark equity gauges. Reliance will report quarterly earnings after close of trading on Jan. 16.ETMarkets.comPressure on the stock intensified this week after several of India’s largest retailers flagged weaker-than-expected consumer demand, stoking concern that Reliance — a major player in the segment — could face a similar slowdown. Sentiment worsened afterUS Senator Lindsey Grahamproposed legislation targeting countries that buy Russian oil, pushing the shares’ weekly decline past 7%, the steepest in more than 15 months.The weakness follows an almost 30% rally in Reliance shares last year, fueled by expectations that the oil-to-telecom conglomerate was preparing to list Jio Platforms Ltd. in what could be India’s biggest initial public offering. Growing concern over tougher US action on Russia has since cooled investor appetite for the company, which in recent quarters has benefited from refining discounted Russian crude.Goldman Sachs Group Inc. analysts expect the company’s retail business to report slower growth for the quarter through December on lower discretionary spending but the same would be offset by a strong growth in energy business.Live EventsThe recent selloff in shares was “potentially due to concerns around refining exposure to Russian crude and softer retail growth momentum across peers,” analysts including Nikhil Bhandari wrote in a note dated Jan. 9. Notwithstanding a moderation in Russian crude volumes, they see the company’s refining margins getting support from tight product markets through next year.The stock still",2026-01-22,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/reliance-industries-loses-15-billion-market-cap-in-bruising-start-to-2026/articleshow/126433588.cms,neutral,economictimes,,,,1

"BofA takes a measured view on Meesho’s next phase, starts coverage with 'neutral' rating; stock sheds 5%","BofA Securities on Monday initiated coverage on newly listed e-commerce firmMeeshowith a Neutral rating and a price target of Rs 190 per share. The brokerage pointed to emerging monetisation drivers in advertising and logistics, while maintaining a measured stance on valuation following the stock’s sharp post-IPO rally.BofA highlighted Meesho’s shift in its advertising model and its approach to logistics as key elements shaping the company’s longer-term outlook. At the same time, the Neutral rating signals caution as the stock transitions from listing-driven momentum to closer scrutiny of execution and valuation.Shares of Meesho fell as much as 5% on Monday to Rs 162.10. The decline followed a 3% rise on Friday, after the stock had slipped for three consecutive sessions.Ads and logistics emerge as key leversBofA flagged advertising as an important monetisation driver, noting Meesho’s move away from a cost-per-click (CPC) model towards a return-on-investment-based approach. According to the report, sellers faced challenges under the CPC model as the “average seller in India didn’t fully understand the CPC product” and ad spends “didn’t lead to conversions.”By contrast, the brokerage said merchants prefer ROI-based advertising, which is “more outcome-driven.” BofA noted that Meesho’s ad engine is along the lines of the “GMVmax” model used by platforms such as TikTok Shop and Shopee, adding that the shift has led to a consistent increase in ad revenues.Live EventsLogistics was identified as the second monetisation driver. BofA said Meesho’s ability to serve value-focused users efficiently stems from its continued efforts to reduce logistics costs. The brokerage noted that Meesho prioritises keeping logistics costs low for sellers rather than extracting profits from its logistics network, a strategy that allows sellers to offer a wider range of affordable products.Stock still well above IPO priceDespite Monday’s decline,Meesho sharescontinue to trade well above their IP",2026-01-22,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/bofa-takes-a-measured-view-on-meeshos-next-phase-starts-coverage-with-neutral-rating-stock-sheds-5/articleshow/126483300.cms,neutral,economictimes,,,,1

Tiger Global saga: An interpretation of maladies that's open to more ills,"What's next in theTiger Globalsaga? The buzz is that over the past few daysPricewaterhousehonchos and partners of the law firmNishith Desai Associateshave been discussing theSupreme Court verdictwith legal eagleHarish Salve, sparking a chatter in tax and legal circles that the Wall Street investment firm may examine moving a review petition. Some are betting New Delhi may step in to clear the fog. Why?The wheels within wheels in the 150-page verdict has turned Tiger's tussle with the tax office far from an open and shut case: it would shape the way investors interpret the language of a tax treaty-an animal that emerged in 1920s from the League of Nations.What really changed? Besides doubting thetax residency certificate(TRC) that Tiger Global Mauritius obtained from the island authorities to avoidcapital gains tax, the apex court's interpretation of a crucial article in the India-Mauritius treaty is dramatically different from that of investors, particularly those from the US, and their army of top notch advisors.UPTURNING BELIEFSThe paragraphs 18 and 19 of the ruling are lethal as they upturn the way most believe treaties work. The upshot of paragraph 18 is that capital gains tax should not be exempted for 'indirect transfer' of shares of an Indian company, even if the Mauritius entity has a foolproof TRC and adequate commercial substance which satisfies tax officials.Live EventsA 'direct transfer is a transaction where a Mauritius investor sells shares of an Indian company it directly holds; an 'indirect transfer' is when a Mauritius investor sells shares of a Singapore company which in turn owns an Indian company - similar to the Tiger-Flipkart deal.The bone of contention is Article 13(4) in the revised India-Mauritius treaty which says: ""Gains from alienation of any property other than referred to in paragraphs 1, 2, 3 and 3A shall be taxable only in the contracting state of which the alienator is a resident"". Here, ""alienator"" (or seller) is Tiger Mauritius, ""c",2026-01-22,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/tiger-global-saga-an-interpretation-of-maladies-thats-open-to-more-ills/articleshow/126737456.cms,neutral,economictimes,,,,1

IFCI shares surges 30% in 5 days on NSE IPO buzz,"Shares of leading NBFCIFCIjumped as much as 4.6% to Rs 63.48 in Monday’s trade, taking gains to nearly 30% over the past five sessions. The surge has been fuelled by renewed optimism around the proposed National Stock Exchange (NSE) IPO, given IFCI’s indirect stake in the exchange.IFCI holds a 52% stake in Stock Holding Corporation of India (SHCIL), which owns 4.4% of NSE as of the December quarter. With NSE shares quoted around Rs 2,100 in the unlisted market, SHCIL’s stake is valued at close to Rs 23,000 crore. Through its holding in SHCIL, IFCI enjoys indirect exposure to NSE, making its stock highly responsive to IPO-related developments.NSE IPOExpected Soon: Sebi chairperson Tuhin Kanta Pandey said the regulator could greenlight the much-awaited NSE IPO as soon as this month, adding that the process for issuing the no-objection certificate (NOC) is in its final stages.Pandey also asserted that Sebi has agreed in principle to NSE's settlement application in a long-standing unfair market access case.

Fresh curbs on insurance commissions likely as expense breaches mount in FY25,"Less than two years after IRDAI scrapped product-wisecommission caps, regulators warn rising distribution costs are inflating premiums. RBI’s Financial Stability Report too echoes concerns. A council-level committee is reviewing compensation norms as breaches surge, sparking debate on reinstating ceilings. In FY25, several life and non-life insurers exceeded expense limits, seekingregulatory forbearanceamid mounting scrutiny.“A committee has been formed to review distribution compensation in the insurance industry amid concerns that commissions have surged sharply since the removal of caps, with discussions underway on whether ceilings should be brought back,” said a source close to the development. “No decision has been taken yet, but the debate has intensified after commission payouts in the sector rose in FY25.”Under the IRDAI (Expenses of Management, including Commission, of Insurers) Regulations, 2024, insurers are required to operate within expense caps linked to product structure, premium-paying term and the duration of business. In FY25, many insurance companies breached the limit. In the life insurance segment, only 17 of the 25 insurers stayed within the prescribed limits, while eight exceeded the thresholds on an overall basis across participating, non-participating and linked products.Industry executives say the discussion is not about reverting to the earlier regime, but about designing a new framework. They say that going back to product-wise commission caps would be a step backward, they argue, given changes in product design, persistency norms and distribution economics.Executives say data shows a positive correlation between high first-year commissions and mis-selling complaints in the first policy year. While insurers believe that reasonable commissions are necessary to improve insurance penetration, they also say that overpaying distributors encourages aggressive sales practices, benefiting intermediaries while policyholders and insurers bear the",2026-01-22,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/fresh-curbs-on-insurance-commissions-likely-as-expense-breaches-mount-in-fy25/articleshow/126363554.cms,neutral,economictimes,,,,1

Metal stocks surge up to 18% in 2026: Top 6 gainers powering the rally. How many in your portfolio?,"Riding a powerful mix of global and domestic tailwinds, the Nifty Metal index has emerged as the joint-best performer so far in calendar year 2026, climbing 4.5%. Record-high silver prices, tightening copper supply chains, India’s safeguard duty and a renewed capex push have lifted investor appetite for metal stocks. Here are the six stocks that have driven the rally this year. Shares of the company have risen 18% to become the best performer on the Nifty Metal index. Aluminium prices in global markets are trading at the highest level in over three years, with prices on the LME crossing $3,100 per tonne for the first time since 2022 earlier this month. The Anil Agarwal-led company has risen 12% in 2026 so far. According to Nuvama Institutional Equities, which has a target price of Rs 806, Vedanta is nearing the completion of regulatory approvals required for its demerger. Strong commodity prices, cost optimisation, and volume growth are expected to reinforce the company’s earlier investment thesis. One of India’s leading copper producers has seen its share price rally over 10% in 2026 alone. Analysts have pegged the target price at Rs 650 per share, which implies an upside potential of 15% from current market levels. The stock has risen 8% in 2026. Institutional interest has also improved. Foreign Institutional Investors increased their stake in the company from 3.71% to 5.05% during the September 2025 quarter. Goldman Sachs offers a slightly bearish view, as it expects the London Metal Exchange copper price to remain in a range of $10,000 to $11,000. Strong global demand growth from grid and power infrastructure, backed by investment in strategic sectors such as AI and defence, is expected to keep prices from falling below $10,000. The LME copper price is forecast to average $10,710 in the first half of 2026. The stock price has risen 7% in 2026 as silver continues to clinch fresh records of $90 per troy ounce. It ranks among the world’s top five silver producers,",2026-01-22,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/metal-stocks-surge-up-to-18-in-2026-top-6-gainers-powering-the-rally-how-many-in-your-portfolio/slideshow/126541398.cms,neutral,economictimes,,,,1

"Sebi proposes uniform trading disclosures, higher net-worth for margin trading","India's markets regulator on ‍Friday proposed to ​issue a uniform set of trading-related ⁠disclosure requirements to standardise compliance across India's three stock exchanges and two commodity exchanges.Securities and Exchange ‌Board of ‌India, in addition, recommended increasing the net-worth requirement for ‌stock brokers providing margin trading facility to a minimum 50 million Indian rupees ($554,926.64), up from the existing 30 million rupees.SEBI also proposed that ​liquidity enhancement rules, which ​are financial incentives for brokers to boost ‌trading ‍volumes, currently used for equity ‍and equity derivatives, should be applied to ‌commodity derivatives as well.The regulator said that such schemes, however, should not create artificial volumes, not take away liquidity from the market and not be manipulative in nature.Any exchange commencing a new ‍segment can provide incentives of up to 25% of their net ‍worth in ⁠the first ⁠five years, after which they can offer incentives up to 25% of their profits for the product, SEBI said.Live EventsThis proposal could benefit India'sNational Commodity and Derivatives Exchange(NCDEX), which plans to launch equity offerings this year.($1 = 90.1020 Indian rupees)Addas a Reliable and Trusted News SourceAdd Now!(You can now subscribe to ourETMarkets WhatsApp channel) (You can now subscribe to ourETMarkets WhatsApp channel)",2026-01-22,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/sebi-proposes-uniform-trading-disclosures-higher-net-worth-for-margin-trading/articleshow/126438299.cms,neutral,economictimes,,,,1

"Ahead of Q3, HDFC Securities recommends a buy on Infosys, HCL, 5 more IT stocks for up to 52% upside","The Indian IT services sector is heading into a seasonally weak Q3FY26, with tier-I players likely to post 0.6–2.1% QoQ constant-currency growth and mid-tier firms ranging from -1.8% to +3.4%, according to HDFC Securities. Furloughs and macro uncertainty are expected to weigh on near-term revenues. Despite these headwinds, the brokerage has identified seven buy-rated stocks, with upside potential of up to 52%. HDFC expects Infosys to report sub 1% CC growth on a sequential basis. However, the second largest IT company will likely increase its FY26E revenue growth guidance by 1% to 3-4% while maintaining a margin band of 20-22%. HCL may post a 1.7% QoQ CC revenue growth while retaining its guidance of 3-5% (4-5% for services) for FY26E. The company is expected to maintain a margin band of 20-22%. LTIMindtree is expected to report within 2% QoQ CC revenue growth in Q3. Birlasoft remains among the top picks for HDFC in the mid-tier segment. Birlasoft will likely witness 1.1% QoQ growth after four quarters, led by manufacturing recovery and improving outlook. The stock gets a buy rating despite being a growth laggard in the mid-tier segment. Sonata will likely see a BFSI client-specific impact, this brokerage noted. Its CC revenue growth is pegged at 0.3%. Happiest Minds Technologies CC revenue growth is estimated at 1.1% Mastek will report 1% QoQ growth, led by NHS, offset by higher furloughs.(Disclaimer: The recommendations, suggestions, views, and opinions given by the experts are their own.

Lemon Tree Hotels shares rally 4% as Warburg Pincus checks in; Nuvama sees 19% upside,"Lemon Tree Hotels’ shares rallied 4% to their intraday high of Rs 155.90 on the BSE on Monday (January 12), following the announcement of a strategic reorganisation and a fresh investment from global private equity majorWarburg Pincus.The deal involved a Rs 960 crore commitment from Warburg Pincus via Coastal Cedar Investments B.V. into Lemon Tree’s subsidiary,Fleur Hotels.Post the update, Nuvama Institutional Equities reaffirmed its ‘Buy’ recommendation on Lemon Tree, setting a target price of Rs 178 and signalling a 19% upside from the current market price.Meanwhile, it views the transaction as value-neutral for now; the potential upside lies in a re-rating of the asset-light parent entity.Under a composite scheme approved by the Board of Directors, Lemon Tree will reorganise its operations into two distinct platforms:Lemon Tree Hotels Ltd, which will operate as a pure-play asset-light hotel management and branding company, and FleurHotels Ltd, the asset-heavy development and ownership arm.Live EventsWarburg Pincus will acquire APG’s entire 41.09% stake in Fleur under the scheme, and infuse capital up to Rs 960 crore in tranches to support future growth.Also read:TCS, Kotak Bank among 8 stocks nearing ex-dates for bonus, dividend, and stock split. Do you own any?The restructuring is aimed at unlocking long-term shareholder value by enhancing strategic focus and simplifying the corporate structure. A major component of this reorganization includes the demerger of 12 hotels (11 operational + 1 under construction in Shimla) and the transfer of ownership and development undertakings from Lemon Tree to Fleur.Lemon Tree will merge some of its subsidiaries with itself, while others will be merged into Fleur in exchange for share allotments.Once the scheme becomes effective (appointed date: April 1, 2026), Lemon Tree shareholders will own 32.96% of Fleur, while Lemon Tree itself will directly own 41.03%, with Warburg Pincus holding 26.01%, excluding further dilution from",2026-01-22,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/lemon-tree-hotels-shares-rally-4-as-warburg-pincus-checks-in-nuvama-sees-19-upside/articleshow/126475510.cms,neutral,economictimes,,,,1

"Budget 2026 to double down on defence? Motilal Oswal flags capex winners, yield risks ahead of FY27","India’s upcoming Union Budget is expected to send a pointed signal to markets. The government is likely to press ahead with defence-led capital spending even as it tightens fiscal discipline and resists calls for tax giveaways. A budget preview by Motilal Oswal suggests the February 1 exercise will prioritise defence and allied industries, infrastructure-linked manufacturing, power, electronics, pharmaceuticals and critical minerals, while keeping a tight lid on revenue expenditure and relying heavily on dividends from the Reserve Bank of India to balance the books.The brokerage expects the gross fiscal deficit to edge down to 4.3% of GDP in FY27 from 4.4% in FY26, marking what it calls a historic shift towards using debt-to-GDP as the primary fiscal anchor. The budget, it said, is likely to be framed around a nominal GDP growth assumption of about 10.1%, providing limited headroom to support growth without undermining consolidation.Capex over populismMotilal Oswal does not expect any populist measures or direct tax changes in the coming budget, arguing that the government’s focus remains firmly on medium-term credibility. Capital expenditure is forecast to rise 10.3% year on year to Rs 12.4 trillion in FY27, holding steady at around 3.1% of GDP, even as revenue spending growth moderates.Defence and allied industries are expected to dominate the capex push. The brokerage notes that the Defence Acquisition Council has already approved capital acquisition proposals worth Rs 790 billion in its winter session, taking FY26 year-to-date approvals to about Rs 3.3 trillion, nearly double the budgeted defence capital outlay for the year. Other sectors expected to see continued policy support include nuclear energy, electronics manufacturing, power, pharmaceuticals and strategic investments linked to critical minerals.Live EventsBeyond traditional infrastructure, the brokerage highlighted digital technologies embedded in agriculture, healthcare and social sectors, as well as",2026-01-22,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/budget-2026-to-double-down-on-defence-motilal-oswal-flags-capex-winners-yield-risks-ahead-of-fy27/articleshow/126519121.cms,neutral,economictimes,,,,1

"FPIs' selling spree continues; Rs 22,530 cr pulled out from equities in January","Foreign portfolio investorswithdrew over Rs 22,530 crore (USD 2.5 billion) from Indian equities so far this month amid risingUS bond yieldsand a stronger dollar, continuing their selling streak from last year.This came following an outflow of Rs 1.66 lakh crore (USD 18.9 billion) recorded in 2025, triggered by volatile currency movements, global trade tensions and concerns over potential US tariffs and stretched market valuations.This sustained selling pressure by foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) has significantly contributed to the nearly 5 per cent depreciation of the rupee against the dollar during 2025.According to data fromNSDL, FPIs pulled out Rs 22,530 crore from Indian equities between January 1 and 16.Market experts attributed the continued withdrawal to a combination of global and domestic factors.Live Events""Rising US bond yields and a stronger dollar have improved risk-adjusted returns in developed markets, prompting capital reallocation away from emerging markets,"" said Sachin Jasuja, Head of Equities and Founding Partner at Centricity WealthTech.Echoing similar views, Himanshu Srivastava, Principal-Manager Research at Morningstar Investment Research India, said elevated US bond yields and dollar strength have made US assets relatively more attractive.He added that geopolitical and trade-related uncertainties continue to weigh on emerging market risk appetite.According to V K Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist at Geojit Investments, lingering uncertainty over the US-India trade agreement has also dampened investor sentiment.On the domestic front, relatively rich valuations in certain market segments, along with mixed cues from the ongoing earnings season, have led to profit-taking and portfolio rebalancing by foreign investors.The persistent depreciation of the rupee, down nearly 5 per cent in 2025 and weakening further to around 90.44 per dollar recently, has eroded dollar returns despite stable index levels, adding further pressure on FPI flow",2026-01-22,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/fpis-selling-spree-continues-rs-22530-cr-pulled-out-from-equities-in-jan/articleshow/126638853.cms,neutral,economictimes,,,,1

"Infosys shares may jump up to 10% tomorrow if ADR is an indicator. Target prices go up to Rs 2,076","Infosys Ltd, one of India’s leading information technology companies, could see strong buying on Friday, January 16, after several brokerage firms raised their target prices following a positive surprise from the company. Infosys lifted its constant-currency revenue growth guidance for FY26 to 3-3.5%, from the earlier 2-3% band, signalling a clearer improvement in demand conditions.Overnight, Infosys American Depositary Receipts (ADRs) surged 10% following the guidance upgrade.The improved outlook stands out against a challenging backdrop for large-cap Indian IT services companies, which continue to face cautious client spending, slower decision-making cycles, and sustained margin pressures from regulatory and wage-related costs.The optimism came despite a mixed set of quarterly numbers. Infosys reported a 2% year-on-year decline in consolidated net profit to Rs 6,654 crore for the December quarter, compared with Rs 6,806 crore a year earlier, while revenue from operations rose 9% to Rs 45,479 crore. Alongside the guidance upgrade, the company retained its margin outlook at 20–22% for FY26.Indian stock markets are closed for trading today on account of the Maharashtra municipal elections.Live EventsShould you buy, sell or hold?Jefferies, which has a Buy call and a target price of Rs 1,880 per share, sees an upside potential of 17% from current levels. The international brokerage believes Infosys’ upgraded FY26 constant-currency revenue growth guidance of 3–3.5% largely reflects Q3 outperformance rather than an improvement in Q4 demand, even as management commentary remained upbeat.With Q4 growth guidance broadly in line with what was earlier indicated for the second half of FY26, Jefferies sees the revision as driven mainly by the Q3 beat. It has raised revenue estimates by up to 1% and expects Infosys to deliver a 7.5% recurring EPS CAGR over FY26–28.Nomura reiterated its bullish stance on Infosys, retaining a Buy rating and a target price of Rs 1,810, while contin",2026-01-22,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/infosys-shares-may-jump-up-to-10-tomorrow-if-adr-is-an-indicator-target-prices-go-up-to-rs-2076/articleshow/126540725.cms,neutral,economictimes,,,,1

These large-caps have ‘strong buy’ & ‘buy’ recos and an upside potential of more than 26%,The way the market reacted to the statement of the new US ambassador to India as he took office on Monday clearly shows how important the India-US deal has become for the street. And it is not just because US exports have been hit badly and there are many companies whose bottomline will be affected by the high tariffs. It is also because the lack of a deal suggests a rift in relations – and that is something the street is not happy about.,2026-01-22,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/these-large-caps-have-strong-buy-buy-recos-and-an-upside-potential-of-more-than-26/articleshow/126489021.cms,neutral,economictimes,,,,1

"Waaree Energies, Premier Energies shares rally up to 5% after China moves to curb solar export rebates","Shares of India’ssolar manufacturingplays rebounded sharply on Monday, withWaaree EnergiesandPremier Energiesclimbing up to 5% after weeks of bruising losses, as investors reacted to a policy shift in China that could ease pricing pressure across the global solar supply chain and revive interest in beaten-down sector leaders.Waaree Energies surged as much as 5.4% to Rs 2,681.8, whilePremier Energiesrose up to 4.4% to Rs 749.5 in early trade on January 12. The gains came after China said it would cancel or sharply reduce tax rebates on a wide range of export products, including solar cells, a move that analysts see as potentially supportive for non-Chinese manufacturers.According to a statement from theChinese finance ministrydated Friday, January 9, and accessed by CNBC-TV18, China will cancel or reduce tax rebates on hundreds of products as it seeks to reassure trade partners over rising Chinese exports.Starting April 1, the Chinese government will remove value-added tax rebates for 249 products, including solar cells, ceramic roof tiles and lithium hexafluorophosphate. The VAT rebate for photovoltaic and other related products will be cancelled from April 1, 2026.The rebate rates on 22 battery-related goods, such as lithium-ion batteries, will be lowered to 6% from 9% earlier, and will be completely removed from January 1, 2027.Live EventsChinese industries, including solar, have been grappling with overcapacity and intense price competition, a backdrop that has weighed on margins and valuations globally.Divergent exposure, shared reliefWhile Premier Energies does not have a significant presence in export markets,Waaree Energiesdoes, making the Chinese policy shift particularly relevant for the latter.The rally marks a pause in a steep selloff for both stocks.

Looking sharp! Trent plans high store density in mature markets,"Mumbai: Tata-ownedTrentis sharpening its focus on store portfolio growth and optimisation, chief executive P Venkatesalu said, as the country's largest fashion retailer by market value sees a gradual recovery in consumer sentiment.The company that pursued an aggressive store expansion strategy in recent years plans to keep adding new outlets in areas where it already has a presence in big cities, as well as move to smaller markets, in the current phase. Amid its quick spread, Trent's stock has seen peaks and troughs. While shares gained nearly seven-and-a-half times since the pandemic, they are down more than a third this past year. The scrip ended near its 52-week low, at ₹3,975.8, on the BSE on Friday.""Consumer sentiment today is neither euphoric nor despondent. It is gradually improving. Outlook over the medium term is positive,"" Venkatesalu told ET. ""The agenda is to pursue growing reach and share of revenues as we selectively increase density of presence across key markets with an improving customer proposition. We expect newer catchments to mature over time, in terms of adoption of fashion trends and density of consumption.""High-Footfall CatchmentsTrent has undertaken one of the fastest expansion drives by any retailer in the country, with its value retail format,Zudio, opening more than 700 stores in the past four years. “We will continue to grow our presence in both existing and new geographies. The smaller markets will mature over time,” Venkatesalu said.Trent’s strategy is similar to some of the world’s largest retailers, including Spain’s Inditex, owner of Zara, and British department store chain Primark, which has long prioritised dense store networks in high-footfall catchments, using scale for more bargaining power with vendors and real estate developers. “We have a mix of home-grown and expatriate talent, but culturally, we remain focused on building a nimble, agile organisation—one that can adapt quickly, listen closely to grassroots signals and take",2026-01-22,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/looking-sharp-trent-plans-high-store-density-in-mature-markets/articleshow/126473440.cms,neutral,economictimes,,,,1

"Bharat Coking Coal IPO listing delayed: Check revised allotment, refund and listing timeline","The listing of Bharat Coking Coal, a subsidiary of Coal India, has been postponed due to municipal elections in Maharashtra. Investors will now have to wait three more days for the stock to debut on the exchanges. Earlier, the company had planned to finalise allotment on January 14, initiate refunds on January 15 and list the stock on January 16. The change was necessitated as stock markets will remain closed on January 15 due to the Maharashtra municipal elections. Under the revised schedule, IPO allotment remains unchanged on January 14. However, refunds will now be initiated on January 16, while the listing has been pushed to January 19. The Rs 1,071 crore IPO saw robust demand, with bids worth over Rs 1.1 lakh crore, making it one of the most heavily subscribed issues in recent years. Investors bid for more than 50.93 crore shares at the upper price band of Rs 23. The issue also set a new benchmark in participation, attracting 90.31 lakh applications, reflecting strong interest from both retail and institutional investors in the PSU subsidiary. The Bharat Coking Coal IPO is currently commanding a grey market premium (GMP) of Rs 14, implying a premium of nearly 61% over the upper issue price. Based on GMP trends, the stock is estimated to list around Rs 37 per share. While the strong GMP indicates positive sentiment and expectations of listing gains, investors should note that grey market premiums are unofficial indicators. Actual listing performance will depend on market conditions and demand on the day of debut.(Disclaimer: Recommendations, suggestions, views and opinions given by the experts are their own.

Exporters shares slump on US warning of higher tariffs,"Mumbai: Shares ofIndian exportersslumped in Thursday's trade as Donald Trump's decision to back a Bill allowing the US to impose500% tariffson Indian imports triggered panic. If this Bill is passed, the additional levies would come on top of the existing 50% tariffs on imports imposed last year, raising the overall burden on imports.Shares of textiles, apparel, seafood and drug makers were among the most hit in weak trading on Thursday. Textile exportersGokaldas Exports,KPR Mill,Vardhman Textiles, andWelspun Livingfell 2-8% on Thursday, while shrimp exportersAvanti Feeds,Apex Frozen FoodsandCoastal Corporationdeclined 2-8%.Pharma stocks likeDr Reddy's Laboratories,Torrent PharmaceuticalsandSun Pharmaceutical, which are currently exempt from tariffs, fell 1-3%.Agenciestextile, pharma stocks take a hit""There is limited near-term clarity on the potential imposition of additional tariffs by Donald Trump, which has weighed on expectations around a US-India trade deal and may affect trade flows,"" said Siddhartha Khemka, head of research, at Motilal Oswal Financial Services.The Bill seeks to penalise nations such as India and China, which buy cheaper Russian oil. According to the Sanctioning Russia Act of 2025, the President must increase the rate of duty on all goods and services imported into the United States from countries that knowingly engage in the exchange of Russian-origin uranium and petroleum products to at least 500% relative to the value of such goods and services.Live EventsThe Bill has poured cold water on expectations of a trade deal between New Delhi and Washington, an outcome that was perceived to reviveinvestor sentiment in Indian equities.On April 2, Trump had initially imposed a 26% reciprocal tariff on Indian export, raising it to 50% by the end of August. Since then, Indian stocks have been under pressure on uncertainty over the fallout of the import tariffs on exporters.Khemka said in the near term, retail investors should wait for some clarity befo",2026-01-22,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/exporters-shares-slump-on-us-warning-of-higher-tariffs/articleshow/126424941.cms,neutral,economictimes,,,,1

Rekha Jhunjhunwala likely exits Canara Bank after taking home multibagger returns,"Veteran investorRekha Jhunjhunwalahas likely exited her holding inCanara Bank, marking the end of a profitable chapter in a long investment journey in the state-run lender. According to the latest shareholding data for the December quarter, her stake in the bank has fallen below 1% for the first time, a position that delivered multibagger returns over several years. The data was not publicly available to find out the exact returns Jhunjhunwalas took home in this investment.Jhunjhunwala's involvement with Canara Bank dates back to August 2021, when Rakesh Jhunjhunwala first picked up a stake in the bank as part of a broader bullish view on public sector banks (PSBs). At the end of the September 2025 quarter, Rekha still held around 1.57% of the bank's equity, having increased her holding marginally by about 0.1% during that period.The recent exit comes after the stock delivered strong gains, rallying nearly 60% over the last year, outperforming several peers in the banking pack.Her late husband, the late ace investor Rakesh Jhunjhunwala, was widely known for his optimistic stance onPSU banks. He believed these lenders were deeply undervalued and poised to benefit from a cyclical recovery in credit growth and improving asset quality.In past interviews, Jhunjhunwala said he was ""extremely bullish on banks and especially on the so-called inefficient banks,"" pointing to the strong deposit-gathering ability, improving credit cycles and cheap valuations as key reasons for his confidence in state-run lenders.Live EventsThe broader PSU banking segment has indeed witnessed renewed interest from investors in 2025, with strong credit growth prospects, valuation support and renewed foreign interest lifting sentiment across state-run lenders.The upcycle in PSUbank stocks, over the years, has been supported by rising credit demand and improving asset quality metrics, providing a favourable backdrop for shares in the space.In the recent second quarter, Canara Bank delivered a robus",2026-01-22,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/rekha-jhunjhunwala-likely-exits-canara-bank-after-taking-home-multibagger-returns/articleshow/126369410.cms,neutral,economictimes,,,,1

Sebi's rap on the knuckles: Investment adviser pulled up for routing client money through employee account,"Market regulator Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) has reprimanded an investment advisor for multiple violations of the Investment Advisers regulations, including routing client funds through the personal bank account of an employee.In a 16-page order, Sebi directedWinway Research's proprietorAnkur Jainto be diligent and careful in his dealings as an Investment Adviser. The regulator found Jain charging fees for the same product for overlapping durations; receiving money from the client in the personal bank account of his employee; failure to maintain call records and to submit call records to Sebi and non-resolution ofSCORES complaints.The order was passed after an enquiry report was submitted to the regulator on November 18, 2024, following certain complaints against Jain on the SCORES portal. Sebi conducted an examination of the complaints to ascertain if the applicable regulatory compliances were being followed by the accused.In his defence, Jain told SEBI that his firm does not accept client fees in any third-party bank accounts, a policy clearly stated in its agreements, invoices, and on its website. He denied allegations of funds being routed to employees’ personal accounts, claiming that certain former employees misused company credentials to carry out unauthorised activities without the firm’s knowledge.Jain argued that the firm cannot be held responsible for the independent actions of ex-employees, citing the absence of vicarious liability, and said SEBI had already been informed about individuals issuing fake invoices using the firm’s name.Live EventsOn charging fees for overlapping periods, Jain said that the allegation that a client was sold services for overlapping periods was due to lack of understanding of the invoicing system before the amendment of 2020 as at that point, a combined bill was raised for all the services. ""The client subscribed for a combination of services and thus, it does not mean that the client was charged for overlap",2026-01-22,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/sebis-rap-on-the-knuckles-investment-adviser-pulled-up-for-routing-client-money-through-employee-account/articleshow/127000141.cms,neutral,economictimes,,,,1

The order comprises two key components — Rs 332 crore for the supply of Anti-Drone Systems (Counter Unmanned Aerial Systems or C-UAS) and Rs 72 crore for training simulators and associated defence equipment.The company said the orders have been placed by a domestic government authority, underscoring its contribution to India’s defence modernisation through advanced indigenous technology. Zen Technologies added that the entire order is expected to be completed within one year, ensuring strong near-term revenue visibility.It has also clarified that there is no involvement of promoters or promoter group entities in the awarding authority. Additionally, the contracts do not qualify as related-party transactions and have been granted on a pure arm’s-length basis, ensuring transparency and regulatory compliance.Investors responded positively to the development, as the order win is seen as a strong endorsement of Zen Technologies’ expertise in defence training systems and counter-drone solutions, and is expected to strengthen the company’s order book and revenue outlook.Live EventsValuation Perspective:Zen Techcurrently has a Price-to-Earnings (P/E) ratio of 45.03, a Price-to-Sales (P/S) ratio of 13.7, and a Price-to-Book (P/B) ratio of 6.43. These ratios suggest that, relative to its earnings, sales, and book value, the stock is trading at a relatively high multiple, indicating it may be somewhat expensive compared to traditional valuation benchmarks.On the technical front, Trendlyne data shows that Zen Tech’s 14-day Relative Strength Index (RSI) stands at 26.5. An RSI below 30 typically signals an oversold condition, suggest",2026-01-22,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/zen-technologies-rallies-over-9-after-bagging-rs-404-crore-defence-orders/articleshow/126558616.cms,neutral,economictimes,,,,1

Shriram-MUFG deal may test rules on non-compete fee for promoters,"Mumbai: India’s largest inbound deal in the financial sector involving Japan's biggest lender has put the spotlight on an unusual $200 millionnon-compete fee, potentially setting up a test case for the country’s securities regulations.Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group(MUFG) Bank has agreed to pay the fee to the promoter ofShriram Finance(SFL) as part of a broader investment plan under which the Japanese lender will acquire a 20% stake in the Chennai-based shadow bank for $4.4 billion.The non-compete payment —amounting nearly 5% of the deal value—is intended to prevent Shriram Ownership Trust (SOT), the promoter entity, from launching a rival lending business under the Shriram brand or any other name.Non-compete fees are not uncommon in M&A transactions but are typically paid to promoters who exit a business after selling their stake and relinquishing control, thereby protecting the buyer’s interests. When Holcim acquiredGujarat AmbujaCement (GACL) in 2006, for instance, the Swiss major paid a non-compete fee to promoters Narotam Sekhsaria and Suresh Neotia after they sold out and ceded control. In the case of SFL, SOT will continue as a promoter, retain management control, and remain a significant shareholder even after MUFG comes on board as a strategic investor. Yet, it will receive a non-compete payment—an arrangement that appears unprecedented in India’s M&A history.Questions have been raised by investors and analysts about the need for a separate financial benefit for SOT and why similar terms are not being offered to non-promoter shareholders. India’s market regulator, theSecurities and Exchange Board of India(Sebi), requires that all shareholders receive “equitable treatment” and that promoters not be paid extra amounts “by whatever name it may be called”.Regulation 26(6) of Sebi’s listing rules states that a promoter cannot enter into any agreement with shareholders or third parties to receive compensation or profitsharing from transactions in the company’s sec",2026-01-22,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/shriram-mufg-deal-may-test-rules-on-non-compete-fee-for-promoters/articleshow/126494747.cms,neutral,economictimes,,,,1

Ahead of Market: 10 things to watch for stock market action on Monday,"Indian equities closed lower on Friday, with the Sensex and Nifty extending losses for a fifth consecutive session as global trade concerns and political uncertainty in Washington weighed on investor sentiment. An early attempt at a rebound quickly faded, with benchmark indices slipping into the red within minutes of the opening as caution returned across the market.The BSE Sensex fell 604.72 points, or 0.72%, to close at 83,576.24, while the NSE Nifty 50 fell 193.55 points, or 0.75%, to finish the session at 25,683.30.Here's how analysts read the market pulse:In India, the market remains in a consolidation phase due to weak global cues, rising bond yields, and persistent foreign institutional investor outflows, despite a supportive Q3 earnings outlook, said Vinod Nair, head of research at Geojit Investments. He added that domestic risk-off sentiment has intensified due to uncertainty over U.S.-India tariff negotiations and escalating geopolitical tensions.Nair said, “Nevertheless, domestic GDP growth is expected to remain strong, and Q3 results should indicate a recovery led by midcaps, potentially stabilising investor sentiment. Despite these heightened geopolitical headwinds, the market is likely to trade within a range with a mixed bias.”Also read |5 Wall Street moguls who dismissed Bitcoin as a fad — Guess what they’re saying now!Live EventsThe Nifty has extended its decline, slipping further below the 50-day exponential moving average, a sign of mounting weakness, said Rupak De, senior technical analyst at LKP Securities. He added that sustained selling pressure pushed the index to a multi-day low at the close.“Market sentiment appears decisively negative. In the short term, the trend might remain weak, with potential downside towards 25,550–25,500. On the higher end, resistance is placed at 25,850,"" De added further.Also read |Warren Buffett’s biggest investment isn’t Apple, BofA or Coca-Cola — it’s a stock hidden in plain sightMost active stocks in terms of",2026-01-22,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/ahead-of-market-10-things-to-watch-for-stock-market-action-on-monday/articleshow/126461456.cms,neutral,economictimes,,,,1

Eternal slides 30% from peak: Can Blinkit parent deliver quick reversal after a 2025 washout?,"Eternal’s stellar rally, which saw its share price surge 520% in less than three years, hit a wall in October, with the stock now down 32% from its lifetime high of Rs 368.45. While the gains came at a frenetic pace, the correction was equally sharp as investors booked profits, wary that the stock had run ahead of its earnings.Shares of the food delivery and quick commerce company are currently trading around Rs 279, with the stock taking 55 trading sessions to slide that far from its peak. After rising 38% between January and October, 2025 turned into a washout year for Eternal, as the stock ultimately ended flat on a year-on-year basis.Kranthi Bathini, Director, Equity Strategy at WealthMills Securities, said the stock is fully priced in, attributing the ongoing correction to the sharp rally Eternal witnessed in 2023 and 2024 and through much of 2025, before the correction set in. He added that the company’s market capitalisation had at one point crossed Rs 3.5 lakh crore, which he termed a red flag.Earnings were also impacted by a slowdown inZomato’s food delivery business andBlinkit’s store expansion, prompting some investors to book profits, he said.At the peak of Rs 368.45, Eternal's market capitalisation shot to Rs 3.55 lakh crore and is now hovering around Rs 2.7 lakh crore.

Hindustan Copper shares jump 4% to 52-week high as copper hits record levels. Can rally sustain in 2026?,"Shares ofHindustan Copperrallied as much 4% to its fresh 52-week high of Rs 574 on January 6, after the globalcopper pricesscaled to fresh peaks fuelled by a renewed rush to ship metal to the US fired up bullish traders and investors. With today’s surge, the stock is up 11% in 2026, rising for all 4 sessions of the year.Benchmark prices on theLondon Metal Exchangesurged as much as 4.4% to $13,000 per metric ton, the latest in a series of leaps higher that have lifted copper more than 20% since mid-November.The rally has been driven by a scramble to ship copper into the US, as the looming threat of import tariffs under President Donald Trump has pushed US copper prices to trade at a sustained premium to those on the LME. This arbitrage has raised concerns about potential copper shortages in other parts of the world and has further emboldened bullish investors, who are already positive on the metal due to its critical role across key growth themes ranging from data centres to electric-vehicle batteries.Can prices sustain? Goldman Sachs offers a slightly bearish view as it expects the London Metals Exchange (LME) copper price to remain in a range of $10,000-$11,000 “as strong global demand growth from the grid and power infrastructure, backed by investment in strategic sectors such as AI and defence” keep prices from falling below $10,000. The LME copper price is forecast to average $10,710 in the first half of 2026.“While the global copper market has been in surplus this year, a combination of limited growth in the supply from mines and rising structural demand from power infrastructure should create more of a balance between supply and demand next year, and lift prices beyond 2026,” the international brokerage said.Live EventsHowever, one factor that could lead to higher demand on the London copper market next year is the potential for the US to place tariffs on refined copper imports.

Sun Pharma looks to rise in US with $10 billion Organon buy,"Mumbai: Sun Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd, India’s largest drugmaker by market cap and revenue, is evaluating the acquisition of US-based Organon, a specialist in women’s health with an expanding presence in the fast-emerging biosimilars space, people familiar with the development told ET. This comes nearly a decade after Sun acquired Ranbaxy.The transaction, likely to come with a $10 billion price tag inclusive of debt, will arguably be the most audacious takeover bid by Sun’s billionaire founder Dilip Shanghvi, 70, known for his astute deal making. A successful transaction will also make it the largest cross-border acquisition in the Indian pharmaceutical space and give Sun significant heft in the US. One of the persons cited said a deal would be “transformative” for Sun.Sun’s advisors include a European bank, which is putting together a comprehensive financial package to be presented to the board of Organon, a company that was spun out by MSD (Merck Sharp & Dohme) in 2021, inheriting $9.5 billion of debt. Since then, it has grown inorganically, including the $1.2 billion acquisition of Roivant’s immuno-dermatology subsidiary Dermavant in September 2024, further leveraging its balance sheet. Organon had debt of $8.9 billion at the end of the second quarter in 2025 and it’s been trying to divest businesses to cut the flab.The company's market cap was at $2.28 billion on the NYSE, with the stock ending at $8.76 on Friday, down from a peak of $17-$18 in November 2024. It shot up 28.1% in the past month, anticipating a successful outcome for sale talks after nosediving 20.9% on October 27, after reports of sales malpractices became public. Then CEO Kevin Ali stepped down soon after. Joseph Morrissey, executive vice president and head of manufacturing and supply, was made interim CEO, while Organon began looking for a permanent leader.Live EventsFor the third quarter of 2025, Organon’s total revenue was $1.60 billion, up 1% on an as-reported basis.

The price action was accompanied by high volumes as nearly a crore shares changed hands on the NSE around 1:30 PM.According to the CNBC-TV18 report, the counsel for the Central Electricity Regulatory Commission (CERC), on Monday, told the APTEL bench that the regulator will not implement market coupling till proper regulations are in place.Meanwhile, Power Minister Manohar Lal Khattar had also indicated that the government's stance on market coupling remains unchanged, the report added.Live EventsIn the previous hearings, the electricity regulator’s counsel had sought time from APTEL to obtain instructions from the CERC on withdrawing the market coupling order.The bench had then noted that it would be incorrect to assume that the 2025 ruling, norms, or orders will automatically continue, indicating that the previous directive may not be upheld.Meanwhile, the CERC had issued a fresh clarification on its July 2025 market coupling order, saying that the order should be read as “directions,” - a move that appears to have heightened investor caution.CERC's July 23, 2025, order introduced a market coupling mechanism - a structural reform that could potentially alter how electricity prices are discovered across power exchanges. The market sees this move as diluting the company’s dominance in price discovery, liquidity, and trading volumes.IEX share price performanceThe stock has fallen over 30% since theCERC orderwas passed, and is currently trading below its 50-day and 200-day simple moving averages (SMAs) of Rs 140.6 and Rs 161.4, respectively, according to Trendlyne data.(Disclaimer:",2026-01-22,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/iex-shares-fall-over-4-ahead-of-aptel-hearing-on-market-coupling/articleshow/126777087.cms,neutral,economictimes,,,,1

"Dow tumbles over 850 pts, posts biggest daily drop in 3 months; Greenland tariff threat triggers selloff","All ⁠three majorWall Streetindexes ended Tuesday with their biggest one-day drops in three months, in a broad selloff triggered by concerns that fresh tariff threats from President Donald Trump against Europe could signal renewed market volatility.The risk-off trade was pervasive, helping vault gold to fresh record highs, and pushing up debt costs with U.S. Treasuries wobbling under renewed selling ‌pressure. Bitcoin, which can find ‌favor when traditional markets waver, fell more than 3%.All three U.S. equity benchmarks registered their worst one-day performance since October 10, with both the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite slipping below their 50-day moving averages.The ‌S&P 500 lost 143.15 points, or 2.06%, to end at 6,796.86 points, while the Nasdaq Composite gave up 561.07 points, or 2.39%, to 22,954.32. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 870.74 points, or 1.76%, to 48,488.59.UNCERTAINTY RISESLive EventsTuesday was the first opportunity for U.S. investors to act on Trump's weekend comments, given the market holiday for Martin Luther King, Jr. Day.This included Trump saying additional 10% import tariffs would take effect on February 1 on goods from Denmark, Norway, Sweden, France, Germany, the Netherlands, Finland and Great Britain - all already subject to U.S. tariffs.The tariffs would increase to 25% on June 1 and continue until a deal was reached for the U.S. to purchase Greenland, Trump wrote in ‌a post on Truth ‍Social. Leaders of Greenland, an autonomous territory of Denmark, and Denmark have insisted the island is not for sale.The ‍reinjection of tariff threats into global markets harkens back to April's ""Liberation Day,"" when Trump's levies ‌on global trade partners pushed the S&P 500 to near bear market territory.The CBOE Volatility Index, also known as Wall Street's fear gauge, spiked to 20.09 points, its highest close since November 24.Trading volumes were also higher: around 20.6 billion shares changed hands on U.S. exchanges on Tuesday, up from the",2026-01-22,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/wall-street-posts-biggest-daily-drop-in-three-months-trump-greenland-tariff-threat-triggers-wide-selloff/articleshow/126897472.cms,neutral,economictimes,,,,1

While the legislation has not yet passed, Senator Lindsey Graham suggested it could face a vote as early as next week.Live EventsTrump also flagged potential higher tariffs on Indian goods if New Delhi does not address U.S. concerns over Russian oil imports.

Emmvee Photovoltaic shares gain 17% in 2 sessions. What’s powering the rally?,"Shares ofEmmvee Photovoltaicrallied as much as 8.5% to hit an intraday high of Rs 217 on January 7, extending gains for a second consecutive session. With today’s move, the stock has surged 17% over the past two sessions.The gains come after global brokerage firm Jefferies initiated coverage on the stock with a Buy rating and a target price of Rs 320, a 60% upside from current levels, citing strong growth visibility, policy support and attractive valuations.Analysts at Jefferies suggest that India's annual solar installations grow at a 24% CAGR between FY25 and FY28, largely aided by falling solar tariffs, rising power demand and the increasing adoption of battery energy storage systems.According to Jefferies, solar power tariffs have consistently remained below the cost of new thermal power over the past four years, making solar the preferred option for utilities and industrial consumers.The recent discovery of solar-plus-storage tariffs in the Rs 3–3.5 per unit range has further strengthened the renewable energy proposition. These tariffs imply battery storage costs of Rs 4.5–5 per unit, which still compare favourably with marginal thermal power tariffs of Rs 5.4–5.8 per unit. Notably, solar-plus-storage contracts lock in prices for 25 years, unlike thermal power where costs escalate annually.Live EventsAgainst this backdrop, Jefferies expects solar to emerge as the dominant renewable energy source in India, with annual installations projected to rise to 65 GW by FY28, from around 34 GW in FY25. Policy support continues to be a key driver for domestic manufacturers, with measures such as the Approved List of Models and Manufacturers (ALMM) and domestic content requirements for public sector projects effectively reserving a significant portion of the market for Indian players.Within this context, Emmvee stands out due to its early adoption of high-efficiency TOPCon cell technology. The company is among the first in India to operationalise large-scale TOPCon cell ca",2026-01-22,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/emmvee-photovoltaic-shares-gain-17-in-2-sessions-whats-powering-the-rally/articleshow/126386975.cms,neutral,economictimes,,,,1
Will Q3 earnings finally end 6 quarters of pain? 70 stocks to watch out for now,"India'sQ3 earningsseason is poised to deliver the strongestprofit growthin two years, with brokerages forecasting a sharp turnaround from six consecutive quarters of disappointing results but the Street remains deeply divided on whether this marks the beginning of a sustained recovery or just another false dawn.Domestic brokerage firmMotilal Oswalexpects stocks under its coverage to clock ""an impressive PAT growth of 16% YoY – the highest in the past eight quarters,"" while Nuvama warns that ""Q3FY26E earnings are likely to stay soft—a continuation of the previous six quarters"" with profit growth of just 5% YoY. The split reflects mounting uncertainty over whether financials, autos, and industrials can offset weakness in export-facing sectors as India navigates slowing global trade and trade-deal uncertainties with the US.Emkay Global sees a definitive pickup in earnings and turnaround in Q3FY26E breaking the last 6-quarter consolidation, projecting 14.5% PAT growth driven by festive season demand and GST rate-cut tailwinds. The firm expects the BSE500 to register 14% PAT growth versus 8.5% for the Nifty, signaling broader market strength.On the other hand, JM Financial forecasts Nifty Q3 PAT growth of 9.8% YoY, up from 8.4% in Q2, with telecom surging 64% YoY, autos accelerating 33%, and industrials jumping 31%. ""After delivering 9.5% growth in Q1 and 8.4% in Q2, Nifty50 would deliver YoY PAT growth of 9.8% in Q3,"" the brokerage said.Motilal Oswal expects 20 sectors/segments to post growth in double digits, marking the completion of the full circle of earnings recovery since it first started to weaken in Q1. The firm sees telecom profits jumping 2.6x, cement surging 66%, real estate up 64%, and capital goods rising 24%.Live EventsBut Nuvama strikes a cautious note: ""Overall, an earnings recovery is still elusive. Nifty EPS is likely to be flat YoY, posing downgrade risks to consensus estimates of mid-teens profit growth in H2FY26/FY27.""

"Rs 8 lakh crore shock! Why 2026 winter is turning harsh for Sensex, Nifty and whether to buy the fear","In the first few trading days of the new year, nearly Rs 8 lakh crore in market capitalisation has been wiped out, marking the worst start to a calendar year for the Indian stock market in a decade. TheSensexand Nifty are down about 2% each, with the total market capitalisation of all BSE-listed companies falling by around Rs 7.6 lakh crore to Rs 468 lakh crore so far in 2026.The immediate pressure point has been global money flows. Foreign institutional investors (FIIs) are 92% short in index futures and have already pulled out $2 billion from Dalal Street amid renewed anxiety over delays in an India–US tariff deal.That uncertainty has kept domestic markets on edge, even as negotiations are expected to restart this week, a development that has offered only limited relief so far.“The market is kind of waiting for that one word called tariff,” said Chakri Lokapriya, CIO-Equities at LGT Wealth. “Until there is a kind of resolution, we are going to be range-bound because that creates a lot of uncertainty.”Adding to the caution is the looming Union Budget in February, where investors are watching closely for a renewed push on capital expenditure after two muted years.Live EventsMarkets stuck in a tight rangeFrom a technical standpoint, the benchmarks are showing little conviction.The Nifty has entered a consolidation zone between 25,473 and 25,900, with analysts warning that a decisive break on either side could set the next directional move. Key support lies in the 25,600-25,500 range, levels that have held so far but remain vulnerable.“In the short term, sentiment is likely to remain weak with potential for further downside,” said Rupak De, Senior Technical Analyst at LKP Securities. “Support is placed at 25,600, below which a deeper correction may unfold. On the higher end, resistance is placed at 25,835.”With earnings season underway, tariff negotiations in flux, and the Budget still two weeks away, traders expect markets to remain largely sideways.While large-cap s",2026-01-22,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/rs-8-lakh-crore-shock-why-2026-winter-is-turning-harsh-for-sensex-nifty-and-whether-to-buy-the-fear/articleshow/126538419.cms,neutral,economictimes,,,,1

Vedanta shares slide 4% as metal stocks reel under broad sell-off. Is the dip worth buying?,"Shares ofVedanta Ltddeclined 4.4% on Thursday to an intraday low of Rs 595 on the BSE, tracking a sharp sell-off across the metals space. The stock came under pressure as weakness in global and domestic commodity prices weighed on sentiment, dragging metal counters lower through the session.Around 1 pm, futures contracts of key metals were trading firmly in the red.Silver futures were down nearly 3%, while gold slipped over 0.6%. Base metals also saw losses, with copper, zinc, and aluminium futures trading lower during the day.Reflecting the broad-based weakness, theNifty Metal indexwas down close to 3%, and all its constituents were trading in negative territory. Stocks such asHindalco,Hindustan Zinc,JSW Steel,NMDC,NALCO,Tata Steel, andJindal Steelwere among the notable laggards.The pressure in the metal space may be attributed to profit booking after recent highs, coupled with a sharp correction in commodity prices, which weighed on metal producers across the board.Live EventsVedanta target price and technical viewCommenting on the stock’s near-term outlook, Kunal Parar, Vice President and Technical Research Analyst at Choice Equity Broking, told ET NOW Swadesh thatVedantashares are witnessing profit booking after hitting record highs near Rs 630.From a trading perspective, Parar said his view remains cautious in the near term as some cooling off may continue.

PNB puts on the block ₹760 cr of bad loans,"Mumbai:Punjab National Bankhas once again put bad loans worth more than ₹760 crore up for sale, including accounts such as Gammon India andSimbhaoli Sugars, bid documents reviewed by ET showed. This follows a much larger sale attempt last week, when the bank invited expressions of interest fromasset reconstruction companies(ARCs) for loans aggregating ₹2,500 crore.According to the bid document, the lender is offering non-performing loans of ₹514 crore owed by civil contractor Gammon India and ₹226 crore by Simbhaoli Sugars. It is also seeking to sell ₹94 crore of loans to Ranchi Expressways, along with smaller exposures to Shree Basaveshwar Sugars, D.H. Enterprises India and Bros Entertainment Shoppe.On December 27, ET had reported that Punjab National Bank (PNB) invited bids from ARCs to sell bad loans worth ₹2,560 crore. Those accounts included ₹468 crore owed by Millennium Expressway, ₹390 crore byAban Offshore, ₹314 crore by Gupta Power and Infrastructure, and ₹236 crore by Moser Baer, in addition to about 20 other corporate loan accounts.The move marks a relatively rare instance in recent times of a bank offering corporate loan accounts for sale, as lenders have largely been prioritising the disposal of retail and microfinance portfolios.In an interview in August, PNB managing director and chief executive Ashok Chandra said the bank had identified over 100 non-performing accounts with an aggregate value of ₹4,000-5,000 crore for sale to ARCs. ""We expect to recover something in the range of 40-50%, minimum,"" Chandra had told PTI.Addas a Reliable and Trusted News SourceAdd Now!(You can now subscribe to ourETMarkets WhatsApp channel) (You can now subscribe to ourETMarkets WhatsApp channel)",2026-01-22,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/pnb-puts-on-the-block-760-cr-of-bad-loans/articleshow/126404493.cms,neutral,economictimes,,,,1

How to calculate dividend yield: A key metric for income investors,"Jan 12, 2026 The Dividend Yield Ratio measures the annual dividend income an investor can expect from a stock relative to its market price.Dividend Yield = Annual Dividend per Share / Market Price per Share × 100.Purpose: It helps investors assess how much income they can earn from dividends compared to the price they pay for the stock. Image Source: ETMarkets.com Income Focused Investors: A higher yield can indicate a good source of regular income. | Risk Indicator: A very high dividend yield might signal that a stock is risky or overvalued. Comparison Tool: It allows investors to compare returns between different stocks or other income-generating assets, like bonds. Image Source: ETMarkets.com If a stock pays an annual dividend of Rs 5 per share and the stock price is Rs 100. Dividend Yield = 5/100×100=5%. This means you earn 5% of the stock's price annually in dividend income. Image Source: ETMarkets.com Steady Dividends: Companies with consistent or growing dividends often signal financial stability.

"Adani Power in focus as NCLAT clears Rs 4,000-crore Vidarbha Power acquisition","Shares ofAdani Powerare expected to remain in focus today during the trading session on January 20 after the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT) upheld the company’s Rs 4,000-crore acquisition of Vidarbha Industries Power.The Insolvency and Bankruptcy Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT) has dismissed appeals filed by Western Coalfields and Pradeep Sot, an employee of debt-laden Vidarbha Industries Power, challenging the earlier approval granted by the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT). With this ruling, Adani Power has secured significant legal support for its resolution plan.A two-member NCLAT bench upheld the Mumbai bench of the NCLT’s decision approving Adani Power’s resolution plan for Vidarbha Industries Power. The appellate tribunal noted that the objections raised by the petitioners were without substance and failed to demonstrate any breach of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC).In an 18-page judgement dated January 16, the NCLAT stated that Adani Power’s resolution plan complied with all statutory requirements. The judgment further noted that the Committee of Creditors (CoC) had exercised its commercial discretion fairly and lawfully. The tribunal concluded that there were no valid grounds to interfere with the NCLT’s approval of the resolution plan submitted by Adani Power.Sensex, Nifty today: Catch all the LIVE stock market action hereLive Events“We are of the view that no grounds have been made out to interfere with the impugned order approving the resolution plan submitted by Adani Power,” the NCLAT said in a statement.On the stock performance front,Adani Power sharesclosed 1.46% lower at Rs 140.56 on the NSE in Monday’s trading session.On the valuation front, the stock is trading at a price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple of 22.86.

"What do Trump’s Greenland tariff threats to NATO allies mean for gold, silver and Dalal Street?","U.S. President Donald Trump’s latest bid to force a deal on Greenland, this time by threatening steep tariffs on a cluster of NATO allies, has injected fresh uncertainty into global markets, potentially pushing investors toward gold and silver while raising short-term volatility risks for equities, including in India, even as longer-term trade opportunities quietly come into focus.On Saturday, Trump said the U.S. would impose a 10% tariff from 1 February 2026 on imports from Denmark, Norway, Sweden, France, Germany, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands and Finland, escalating the levy to 25% from 1 June if those countries refuse to negotiate the sale of Greenland, a Danish territory. The announcement, made in a social media post, marked Trump’s most aggressive attempt yet to pressure Europe over the strategically important Arctic island.Tariffs as leverageTrump said the tariffs would remain in place “until a Deal is reached for the Complete and Total purchase of Greenland,” arguing that U.S. control of the island is essential to counter Chinese and Russian ambitions in the Arctic. Denmark and its European allies have rejected those demands, triggering a rare show of unity among European leaders, who reacted with outrage on Saturday.The threat also drew criticism from U.S. lawmakers, including some members of the president’s own party. Adding to the uncertainty, the U.S. Supreme Court is currently weighing whether to overturn the legal authority Trump has used to threaten tariffs under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act. If the court rules against him, Trump may not be able to impose the new levies.The proposed duties would likely be imposed on top of existing tariffs, currently 10% on British imports and 15% on imports from the European Union, raising questions about retaliation and the broader impact on global trade. While tariffs are paid by importers, the costs are often passed on to American consumers, complicating the inflation outlook.Safe havens b",2026-01-22,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/what-do-trumps-greenland-tariff-threats-to-nato-allies-mean-for-gold-silver-and-dalal-street/articleshow/126640083.cms,neutral,economictimes,,,,1

Top 10 smallcap stocks tumble up to 20% in 2026. Is your portfolio at risk?,"After a bruising 2025, when the Nifty Smallcap 100 index fell nearly 6%, 2026 is shaping up to be another difficult year, at least judging by January’s early trend. The index is already down about 2%, with several stocks sliding as much as 20% in just the first few trading sessions. Here are 10 stocks that have led the sell-off in the index at the start of the new year. The cigarette maker has emerged as the worst performer in the space, plunging 20%, amid heightened regulatory and policy scrutiny. Cigarette taxes are expected to rise by 38% to 50%, depending on cigarette length, with longer king-sized variants facing a steeper increase. This translates into a weighted-average tax hike of around 40% to 42%. The stock has dropped 14% so far in 2026, after slipping 6% in 2025. The company operates in the energy technology space, offering solutions across electrification, automation and digitalisation for homes, buildings, data centres, infrastructure and industries, with a focus on energy management. Shares of the infrastructure major are down 12.5% in 2026. The company is a leading player in India’s infrastructure sector, with a strong presence in highway development through EPC (Engineering, Procurement and Construction) and BOT (Build-Operate-Transfer) models. The Tata Group company has seen its stock fall 11.5% in 2026. Rallis is a leading Indian agrochemicals firm, supplying farmers with crop protection products such as pesticides and fungicides, along with crop nutrition solutions including speciality nutrients and bio-stimulants. The stock has declined 11% so far in 2026 and is down about 26% over the past six months. The company is engaged in developing residential properties and commercial complexes. Shares of the home textiles exporter have slipped 10.22% in 2026. The decline has been driven largely by trade tariff concerns after US President Donald Trump warned of 500% tariffs on countries purchasing Russian oil, including India. Indo Count is a leading man",2026-01-22,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/top-10-smallcap-stocks-tumble-up-to-20-in-2026-is-your-portfolio-at-risk/slideshow/126543265.cms,neutral,economictimes,,,,1

"IEX shares rebound 3%, snap 2-day fall. Should investors buy, sell or hold?","Shares ofIndian Energy Exchange(IEX) rose as much as 3% to an intraday high of Rs 142 on January 12, snapping a two-session losing streak in which the stock had fallen about 10%. The rebound appears to reflect value buying emerging at lower levels, with the stock seen as oversold after the recent correction.The company has been in the news off late after it challenged the Central Electricity Regulatory Commission’s (CERC) July 2025 order onmarket couplingbefore the Appellate Tribunal for Electricity (APTEL). Market coupling is a structural reform that could potentially alter how electricity prices are discovered across power exchanges. The market sees this move as diluting the company’s dominance in price discovery, liquidity, and trading volumes.What should investors do?At the hearing held last week, discussions were centred on the process adopted by the regulator rather than on the concept of market coupling itself. While market coupling is still likely to be implemented over time, its timeline remains uncertain given the complexity of execution, the high likelihood of a fresh formulation process and the potential for further litigation.In this context,JM Financialmaintained its Add rating on the stock, valuing it at 30x FY28 EPS to arrive at a base-case target price of Rs 158. That translates to an upside potential of 14.5% from current market levels. Separately, CERC submitted an affidavit stating that it is not withdrawing its order on market coupling, suggesting that the regulatory process remains active but far from conclusive, the brokerage added.Live EventsOn the other hand, Bernstein reiterated an 'Underperform' rating on IEX and set a target price of Rs 115, saying regulatory risks, rather than operating performance, will be the decisive factor for the stock. The brokerage said three issues matter most for IEX: market coupling, transaction charges and trading volumes. While recent legal signals could provide near-term relief, Bernstein warned that structu",2026-01-22,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/iex-shares-rebound-3-snap-2-day-fall-should-investors-buy-sell-or-hold/articleshow/126475788.cms,neutral,economictimes,,,,1

Tata Motors PV shares fall over 4%. What’s triggering the selloff?,"Shares ofTata Motors Passenger Vehicletumbled as much as 4.5% to their day’s low of Rs 338 on the BSE on Monday after US President Donald Trump threatened to impose new additional 10% tariffs on several European countries until the US is allowed to buy Greenland.The development is particularly significant for Tata Motors, given the strong exposure of its British luxury arm,Jaguar Land Rover, to the US market. North America accounted for nearly one-third of JLR’s sales in 2025, driven largely by the US. According to JLR’s FY2024 annual report, the US alone contributed about 22% of global sales, underscoring its importance to the company’s overall performance.This development comes at a challenging time for JLR, which is already dealing with the fallout from a recent production halt triggered by a massive cyberattack. The disruption weighed heavily on performance, with the Range Rover maker reporting a sharp 43.3% year-on-year decline in wholesale and retail volumes in the third quarter of FY26.JLR reported wholesale volumes of 59,200 units in Q3FY26, a steep decline of 43.3% compared with the same period last year. Retail sales for the quarter stood at 79,600 units, down 25.1% year-on-year. The company said volumes were adversely affected as production only returned to normal levels by mid-November following the cyber incident.The automaker noted that both wholesale and retail volumes declined on a quarter-on-quarter as well as year-on-year basis due to these operational challenges. The impact was further compounded by the ongoing planned wind-down of legacy Jaguar models ahead of the launch of the new Jaguar range, which continued to weigh on volumes through the quarter, in line with expectations.Live EventsAdditionally, JLR highlighted that incremental US tariffs affecting exports to the US market also contributed to the pressure on volumes during the quarter.Despite the overall volume decline, the company saw an improvement in its product mix. Higher-margin models",2026-01-22,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/tata-motors-pv-shares-fall-over-4-snap-2-day-gaining-streak-whats-triggering-the-selloff/articleshow/126667912.cms,neutral,economictimes,,,,1

"After blockbuster 2025, metal stocks tumble up to 10% weekly this year. What’s ahead?","After a stellar 2025,metal stockshave entered 2026 on a slightly weaker note, with some names sliding up to 10% in a week. While investors have booked profits amid renewed concerns overUS tariff threats, market experts believe the sector’s strong fundamentals and favourable momentum could still support further upside, advocating a selective stock-picking approach.Even as investors' wealth wiped out by nearly Rs 9 lakh crore in the first seven sessions in the new year, commodities were at the fore-front of the sell-off with metal as the second worst-hit sector after the Oil & Gas.Nifty Metal index's 3% weekly decline was largely triggered by a correction in the last two trading sessions. Individually, Jindal Stainless was the worst performer, slipping 10% over a week. It was followed by Welspun Corp and Jindal Steel which fell 7%, each. Others like Lloyds Metals & Energy, Adani Enterprises, NMDC, Hindustan Copper, Hindustan Zinc, Hindalco Industries, Tata Steel, APL Apollo Tubes, JSW Steel, Steel Authority of India (SAIL) and Vedanta were down between 6% and 1%. The lone gainer was National Aluminium Company (NALCO) with 5% uptick.After the US President Donald Trump greenlit a bipartisan Russia sanctions bill that proposes duties of at least 500% on Russian imports, domestic markets fell sharply.Live EventsAs the concerns around its impact weigh, sectors that have outperformed over a period, run a greater risk of correction.Jashan Arora, Director at Master Trust said that metal sector's super rally in 2025 was not just a momentum play, but a structural change that is expected to gain much dominance through the coming period. ""Commodities cycle in 2025 beat all asset classes in 2025 with leading performance by various metals including gold, silver, copper and zinc and the long-term outlook for the metal remains constructive,"" Arora said.Also read:TVS Motor tops two-wheeler pack with 60% rally in a year.

"Budget 2026: How India introduced, scrapped and raised capital gains taxes for stock market investors","With just days to go forBudget 2026, calls for tax relief are growing louder in the stock market. The demands this time are more noisy given the persistent foreign investor selling, weak equity returns and rising volatility. Market participants hope that any easing ofequity taxation-- particularlylong-term capital gains-- could help revive foreign inflows and restore confidence.Against this backdrop, here is a revisit of how India has taxed stock market gains over the years, why these taxes were introduced, withdrawn and reintroduced, and where they stand today.Before getting into the policy shifts, capital gains refer to the profit an investor makes when selling an asset such as shares, mutual funds or property at a price higher than the purchase cost. In equities, these gains are classified based on how long the investment is held.If listed shares are sold within one year of purchase, the profit is treated as short-term capital gain (STCG). If they are sold after one year, it is long-term capital gain (LTCG). Losses are classified using the same rules.Early days of stock market - The 90sLive EventsIndia's approach to taxing equity gains has evolved over the past three decades. In the early 1990s, long-term capital gains on equities were taxed at 20%, with indexation benefits available. Indexation is a method that adjusts the buying price of the asset for inflation before calculating capital gains. By raising the cost base, indexation reduces the taxable income and reflects the impact of inflation over time.There was no concept of a tax onshort-term capital gainsback then. This structure broadly continued through the 1990s, but high taxes and complex calculations were often seen as discouraging wider market participation.The 2004 shiftIndia's modern capital gains framework for equities took shape in the early 2000s. In 2004, the government introduced the Securities Transaction Tax (STT) on equity trades. At the same time, it abolished long-termcapital gains taxon l",2026-01-22,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/budget-2026-how-india-introduced-scrapped-and-raised-capital-gains-taxes-for-stock-market-investors/articleshow/126763861.cms,neutral,economictimes,,,,1
"Stock market valuation turns favourable after 5 years, re-rating ahead: Morgan Stanley","Stock market valuationsin India have turned favourable relative to bonds andshort-term ratesfor the first time in nearly five years, setting the stage for a potential re-rating in equities, global brokerage firmMorgan Stanley's equity strategistRidham Desaisaid.In his latest strategy report, Desai expects a combination of cheaper valuations, an upswing in earnings, and a supportive macro-policy mix to drive better equity returns over the next 12–24 months. The brokerage has a target of 95,000 for the Sensex in the base case scenario.Morgan Stanley argues that trailing 12‑month equity performance is the worst in India’s recorded history on a relative basis, while valuation metrics such as its modified earnings yield gap are approaching past trough levels that have typically preceded strong market phases. On key relative gauges that compare equity valuations with short-term interest rates, the firm says the indicators have “turned up” after several years, implying that stocks are now inexpensive versus cash and bonds and that the balance of risk and reward has shifted back in favour of equities.The report notes that multiple macro indicators, which historically lead equity returns, have swung into positive territory, including a bullish steepening of the yield curve, a rise in the money multiplier, and a widening gap between nominal GDP growth and the policy rate.The rupee is also considered undervalued on the real effective exchange rate, a setup that has often coincided with stronger forward returns from the Sensex, even though the historical relationship has weakened more recently.Live EventsOn fundamentals, Morgan Stanley expects a “sharp turn” in earnings growth driven by an explicit reflation effort from the Reserve Bank of India and the government via rate cuts, CRR cuts, deregulation and liquidity infusion, as well as front-loaded capex and around Rs 1.5 trillion of GST rate cuts skewed to mass consumption.Its proprietary earnings indicators point to improving",2026-01-22,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/stock-market-valuation-turns-favourable-after-5-years-re-rating-ahead-morgan-stanley/articleshow/126389557.cms,neutral,economictimes,,,,1

RBI's likely to hold interest rates with inflation set to rise,"MUMBAI: The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) is expected to keep itsrepo rateunchanged in its February policy meeting as the central bank would likely wait for parameters that would determine inflation and growth prints in the new base-year series, economists said. This new series, which rolls out from next month, is expected to shift the growth-inflation dynamics as weights that constitute the consumption basket are expected to change to reflect the latest wallet shares of today's needs.Themonetary policy committee(MPC) is set to meet February 4-6, in the same week after the finance minister presents the Union budget.With the December consumer inflation print of 1.33%, Q3 inflation averaged 0.8%. That was 20 bps higher than the RBI's Q3 forecast of 0.6%. Economists believe the RBI will see a similar upside to its Q4 forecast too, which is at 2.9%. The RBI has cumulatively cut policy rates 125 basis points sinceFebruary 2025 to 5.25%.""We do not foresee any further rate cuts for now, as inflation could be above 4% four quarters down,"" said Dhiraj Nim, economist and FX Strategist, ANZ Bank. ""However, durable liquidity infusions are needed both to bring up reserve money growth and ease the prevailing upward pressure on borrowing costs.""Live EventsLooking ahead, economists expect the RBI to inject additional liquidity through open market operations (OMO) to keep systemic liquidity in surplus. With retail inflation projected to rise above 4% after four quarters, policy rates are widely expected to remain on hold during upcoming MPC meetings, shifting market focus to the scale and timing of liquidity support.System liquidity turned deficit in the second half of December and has been in a tight surplus of Rs 36,869 crore on average in January so far, as per RBI data. Soumya Kanti Ghosh, chief economic advisor atState Bank of India(SBI), expects about Rs 2 lakh crore of OMO in the remainder of FY26 and a similar trend in the next fiscal too.

IndiGo posts biggest single-day gain in 16 months,"Mumbai: Shares ofInterGlobe Aviation, parent of IndiGo, jumped over 4% - the highest single-day gain in 16 months - after the Directorate General of Civil Aviation's penalty on the airline for the mass flight cancellations in December was considered lower than what investors expected.The stock closed 4.2% higher at ₹4,937- emerging as the top gainer on the Nifty on Monday. Benchmark Nifty declined 0.4%. This is IndiGo's biggest advance in a day since August 2024.""The DGCA's penalty at ₹22 crore was much lower anticipated, which prompted investors to buy,"" said Sunny Agrawal, head of Fundamental Research atSBISecurities. He said Indigo has lowered operational capacity to comply with the regulations.In early December, the airline cancelled several flights, exacerbated by the implementation of a time limit for crew and grounding of A320 fleet due to software glitches. The disruptions drew criticism as thousands of passengers were left stranded.""Indigo shareswitnessed significant correction since the disruption in December, but given the cooling of issues with DGCA, it is a good company at a cheaper price currently,"" saidSonamSrivastava, founder and CEO, Wright Research.Live EventsSrivastava said the easing of supply-side issues and the softening of crude oil prices are expected to be a tailwind for the company.IndiGo shares are down 13% since early December.

"NALCO shares hit record high, up 12% in 4 sessions. What’s behind the surge?","Shares ofNational Aluminium Company Ltd(NALCO) surged as much as 7% to touch a fresh record high of Rs 352, extending their rally for a fourth straight trading session. With the latest move, the stock has climbed 12% over the past four days.The surge comes afteraluminium pricesin global markets rose 2% to their highest level in over three years, with LME prices breaching the $3,000-per-tonne mark to trade at $3,082. The rally has been driven by tight supply conditions, as a cap on smelting capacity in China and production constraints in Europe due to elevated electricity costs have weighed on global inventories. At the same time, demand prospects remain strong, supported by sustained requirements from the construction and renewable energy sectors, Bloomberg said in a note.Last month, CNBC TV-18 reported that Brijendra Pratak Singh, MD of NALCO, said: Theglobal aluminium marketis expected to move into a supply deficit in 2026 and 2027 as demand continues to rise across multiple sectors. “The demands are increasing from the EV sector, construction sector, power sector, and now huge data centres are coming.NALCO Q2 performanceNalco’s September-quarter net profit climbed 36.7% year-on-year to Rs 1,430 crore, up from Rs 1,046 crore in the same period last year, driven by higher realisations and improved operating efficiency. Revenue rose 31.5% to Rs 4,292 crore from Rs 4,001 crore a year earlier.Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) stood at Rs 1,932.9 crore, marking a 24.8% rise from a year ago. Operating margins expanded to 45% from 38.7%, underscoring stronger pricing power and cost discipline.Live EventsIn a recent note following its Q2 earnings, Axis Securities highlighted that NALCO’s timely expansion and ramp-up of the 5th stream Alumina refinery, with a planned capacity addition of 1 million tonnes per annum (MTPA) by FY27, will be a key growth driver. The capital expenditure (capex) for this project has already seen cost overruns.",2026-01-22,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/nalco-shares-hit-record-high-up-12-in-4-sessions-whats-behind-the-surge/articleshow/126369669.cms,neutral,economictimes,,,,1

"Export-heavy stocks slide up to 7% as Trump threatens 500% tariff; Avanti Feeds, Kitex Garments lead losses","Export-oriented stocks extended their decline for a second straight session on Friday, with names such asKitex Garments,Avanti Feedsamong others sliding up to 7%, after fresh political signals from the US rekindled fears of sharply higher trade barriers.Selling intensified after American Senator Lindsey Graham said that US President Donald Trump had approved a bipartisan Russia sanctions bill that proposes duties of at least 500% on Russian imports and could be used to pressure countries including India, that continues to buy Russian oil.Seafood exporters were among the worst performers during the session, reflecting fears of direct disruption to shipments to the US, the most important market for Indian shrimp exporters. Avanti Feeds dropped 1.2% to Rs 801 , whileApex Frozen Foodsalso fell over 6% to their day’s low of Rs 258 per share.Coastal Corporationdeclined 3.5%,Waterbaseslipped 3% to Rs 44.30, and Sharat Industries lost almost a percent.Textile exporters also came under significant pressure as investors priced in the risk of weaker US demand and higher landed costs in the event of punitive tariffs. KPR Mills tanked 2.6% to Rs 826 per share,Vardhman Textilesfell 0.25%, whileGokaldas Exportsrose over 4% to buck the trend.Indo Count Industries,Sutlej Textiles,Welspun Livingand Kitex Garments traded up to 7% lower.The concerns were compounded by earlier warnings from Trump that Indian exports could face higher tariffs if New Delhi does not address US concerns over its purchases of Russian crude. Currently, the US has already imposed tariffs of up to 50% on certain Indian products, with roughly half of that burden linked directly to India’s Russian oil imports.Live EventsIn a recent report, Crisil said that India’s home textile makers could be staring at a 5-10% decline in revenue this fiscal after the US imposed 50% as exports to the country contribute nearly three-fourths of the industry’s revenue.Crisil expects industry-wide operating profitability to contract",2026-01-22,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/export-heavy-stocks-slide-up-to-11-as-trump-threatens-500-tariff-avanti-feeds-kitex-garments-lead-losses/articleshow/126427354.cms,neutral,economictimes,,,,1

"Sensex sheds over 2,300 points in 5 days, Nifty down 2.5%. Here are 5 key factors rattling stock market","Indian equities slid deeper into the red and closed lower on Friday, with the Sensex and Nifty stretching losses into a fifth straight session as global trade jitters and political uncertainty out of Washington kept investors on edge. What began as a tentative rebound at the opening bell quickly fizzled, with benchmark indices turning sharply lower within minutes as caution took hold across the board.The BSE Sensex has now fallen 2,359.73 points over the past five sessions, sliding from a closing level of 85,762.01 on January 2 to an intraday low of 83,402.28 on Friday. The NSE Nifty 50 has declined by over 2.5% over the same period.At the end of the day, the Sensex was down 604.72 points, or 0.72%, at 83,576.24, while the Nifty fell 193.55 points, or 0.75%, to finish the session at 25,683.30.The selloff has wiped out Rs 8 lakh crore in market capitalisation over five days, taking the total value of BSE-listed companies to Rs 467.78 lakh crore.Here are the key factors weighing on the market:Live Events1. Trump tariff stalemate clouds trade outlookMarkets have been under pressure since U.S. President Donald Trump hinted that tariffs on Indian goods could be raised over India's purchases of Russian crude, keeping the India–US trade relationship in sharp focus.The proposed bilateral trade agreement between India and the U.S. has yet to be finalised, despite six rounds of negotiations since March. U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick claimed on the All-In Podcast that the deal stalled because Prime Minister Narendra Modi did not call Donald Trump. The Trump administration has already imposed 50% tariffs on India, including 25% linked to India’s purchases of Russian oil, among the highest levied on any country. India has described the U.S. action as “unfair, unjustified and unreasonable”.The uncertainty has intensified ahead of a U.S. Supreme Court ruling on the legality of Trump’s tariffs. If deemed “illegal”, the U.S. government could be forced to refund nearly $150",2026-01-22,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/why-is-stock-market-falling-today-sensex-sheds-over-2180-points-in-5-days-nifty-down-2-5-5-key-factors-behind-the-sharp-drop/articleshow/126430040.cms,neutral,economictimes,,,,1

Zerodha’s Nithin Kamath explains why tracking lock-in expiries is a must for IPO investors,"ZerodhaCEO and founderNithin Kamathhas cautionedretail investorsto pay close attention to lock-in periods when investing in initial public offerings (IPOs), noting that large shareholder sell-offs after lock-in expiries can put pressure on stock prices.In a post on the micro-blogging platform X, formerly Twitter, Kamath explained that when a company goes public, not all shareholders are permitted to sell their shares immediately. Certain categories of shareholders such as promoters, early investors and employee stock option (ESOP) holders are typically subject to lock-in restrictions that can range from 30 days to as long as 18 months.These shareholders often hold sizeable stakes, Kamath noted, and their eventual exit can have a material impact on a stock’s performance. “Since these are large shareholders, whenever they sell, there can often be a downward move in the stock price,” he said, flagging a risk that retail investors may overlook while chasing newly listed stocks. Against this backdrop, he advised investors to track lock-in expiries as part of their investment decision-making process, especially when buying shares of recently listed companies.To be sure, data from Nuvama shows that between January 6 and April 30, 2026, pre-listing shareholder lock-in periods are set to expire for 96 companies, covering shares valued at about $45 billion. While this represents the total value of shares becoming eligible for trading, it does not imply that all of them will come up for sale, as a significant portion is held by promoters and promoter group entities.Separately, Kamath, who frequently shares insights on the platform, also highlighted structural limits on the broking business. In a post dated January 6, he said the 15% open interest (OI) cap at the broker level places a hard ceiling on how much a broking firm can grow and the pace of that growth. While the restriction limits scale, he added, it ultimately benefits consumers by reducing concentration risk and prev",2026-01-22,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/zerodhas-nithin-kamath-explains-why-tracking-lock-in-expiries-is-a-must-for-ipo-investors/articleshow/126411606.cms,neutral,economictimes,,,,1
Sebi proposes a 30-day lag for use of price data,"Mumbai: TheSecurities and Exchange Board of Indiahas proposed a time lag of 30 days for sharing price data of listed companies foreducational purposes, in a bid to prevent misuse of such information while keeping educational content relevant.Price data can currently be shared with a one-day lag for preparing content for educational purposes. For using in classrooms and any other media for educational and awareness activities, the data should be at least three months old. The regulator is now proposing a uniform 30-day lag for sharing price data for all educational and awareness purposes.The move comes in the wake of the regulator banning financial influencer Avadhut Sathe of Avadhut Sathe Trading Academy from the securities market for offering unregistered investment advisory and research analyst services. Sebi alleged that Sathe, despite not being registered as an investment adviser, offered advisory services under the guise of stock market training programmes to a large number of investors.Sebi on May 24, 2024 prohibited stock exchanges from sharing real-time price data to third parties, in an attempt to prevent online gaming platforms, apps and websites from using such data of listed companies and the ban is still in force. It then introduced the one-day lag for sharing the data for preparing content and, subsequently, the three-month rule for classrooms and other educational activities.“One of the essential elements distinguishing investor education from advice/recommendation is the market data based on which educational contents are being developed,” Sebi said in a discussion paper on Tuesday.Live Events“Using live data for educational purposes is clearly outside the scope of pure educational activity as it involves analysing current data to predict future prices, which falls under the definition of investment advisory (IA)/ research analyst activity,” it said.The one-day lag is the minimum technical delay to be adhered to by stock exchanges and market intermed",2026-01-22,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/sebi-proposes-a-30-day-lag-for-use-of-price-data/articleshow/126384489.cms,neutral,economictimes,,,,1

On average, five brokerages estimate consolidated revenue to rise 193% year-on-year in Q3, while profit after tax is expected to increase 51% from a year ago.However, analysts caution that margin trends and losses in Blinkit and other newer businesses will remain key monitorables, even as the core food delivery segment continues to show gradual improvement.Food delivery growth in Q3 is expected to be steady, but slightly slower than in previous quarters. Nuvama estimates food delivery net order value to grow 2.2% quarter-on-quarter and 14.1% year-on-year, indicating stable demand but limited acceleration.Domestic brokerage Motilal Oswal expects food delivery order value to rise around 12% year-on-year, with take rates holding at approximately 21.5%. Kotak Equities, meanwhile, projects food delivery gross merchandise value (GMV) growth of 18% year-on-year. On the profitability front, brokerages anticipate incremental margin improvement. Nuvama pegs adjusted EBITDA margin as a percentage of net order value at around 5.4%, while Motilal Oswal expects a sequential improvement of 20 basis points to 5.5%. Kotak Equities models a lower food delivery EBITDA margin of 4.5%, though still improving sequentially.Live EventsBlinkit, the company's quick commerce arm, is expected to be the key growth driver in Q3. Brokerages broadly forecast Blinkit net order value growth of about 14–15% quarter-on-quarter and 122–123% year-on-year, supported by aggressive dark store expansion and higher order density.Despite strong growth, profitabili",2026-01-22,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/eternal-shares-soar-6-head-of-q3-results-today-heres-what-to-expect/articleshow/126951986.cms,neutral,economictimes,,,,1

"MRPL shares jump 7% after three day decline, eyes Venezuelan oil purchases","Shares ofMangalore Refinery and Petrochemicals Ltd(MRPL) rose as much as 7%, reaching an intraday high of Rs 149.40 on the NSE during Wednesday’s trading session. The sharp rebound followed a three day losing streak.The recent decline was triggered by comments from company executives stating that MRPL, a state run oil refiner and fuel retailer, is not importing Russian crude due to Western sanctions and is exploring purchases of Venezuelan oil.According to Devendra Kumar, MRPL’s head of finance, the company is considering Venezuelan crude purchases as it halts Russian oil imports to remain compliant with international sanctions. “We are in strict compliance with all sanctions in place, and currently no Russian crude is being imported,” Kumar stated during an analyst call.MRPL operates a 500,000 barrel per day refinery in Karnataka and exports roughly 40% of its refined fuel output.Prior to the recent three day dip, the stock had surged nearly 9% last week following strong Q3 FY26 results. The company reported a net profit of Rs 1,451 crore, nearly five times the Rs 309 crore recorded in the same quarter last year. Revenue rose to Rs 24,750 crore from Rs 21,904 crore year on year, while margins saw significant improvement, boosting investor confidence.Live EventsValuation and Technical OverviewMRPL’s shares are currently trading at a price to earnings ratio of 11.22 and a price to book ratio of 1.88, reflecting relatively attractive valuations. On the technical front, the 14 day Relative Strength Index stands at 41.4, suggesting that the stock is neither overbought nor oversold.In terms of moving averages, MRPL is trading below four of its eight short term simple moving averages, indicating some near term weakness. However, it continues to trade above its 150 day and 200 day long term simple moving averages, signalling a healthy long term trend.Overall, MRPL’s stock rebound is supported by strong quarterly earnings and its proactive efforts to diversify crude sourcin",2026-01-22,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/mrpl-shares-jump-7-after-three-day-decline-eyes-venezuelan-oil-purchases/articleshow/126935820.cms,neutral,economictimes,,,,1
"Asian stocks edge up before US jobs data, tariff ruling","Asian equities gained modestly at the open after their first two-day slide of the year, with investors bracing for Friday’s US payrolls report and a possible Supreme Court ruling on President Donald Trump’s tariffs.Shares opened higher in Japan and Australia, while South Korea lagged. A flat day for the S&P 500 on Thursday masked selling in tech behemoths such as Nvidia Corp. Treasury futures inched up and mortgage backed securities rallied after Trump said he was directing the purchase of $200 billion of mortgage bonds.The rebound in equities after April’s tariff-driven slump faces a key test from the court ruling, just as investors brace forUS jobs datathat will offer clues on the Federal Reserve’s path for interest rates. In a defensive shift, money has rotated out of richly valued tech giants into smaller companies, tempering the AI-led gains of recent years.“It’s unclear at this point whether this is just a breather or a full rotation,” said Paul Ticu at Calamos Investments. “Markets are still trying to figure out a direction.”The Russell 2000 index of smaller US companies has beaten the Nasdaq 100 by around 4 percentage points in the first five sessions of 2026, the second-best outperformance to start a year on record.Live EventsInvestors will be on guard for US jobs data set to land later Friday. Economists surveyed by Bloomberg anticipate 70,000 new positions were added to the US economy in December, slightly higher than the prior month, while the unemployment rate is expected to fall to 4.5%.Jobs data will help illuminate the path ahead for US interest rates. Money markets are pricing in at least two quarter-point cuts from the Fed in 2026.The Supreme Court is also poised to decide the fate of most of Trump’s tariffs as soon as Friday. Hundreds of companies have already lined up hoping to recoup their share of the billions of dollars in duties paid so far.In other corners of the market, the dollar held on to its gains from the prior session, while oil exten",2026-01-22,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/asian-stocks-edge-up-before-us-jobs-data-tariff-ruling/articleshow/126425212.cms,neutral,economictimes,,,,1

"Sensex, Nifty gain for third day in a row; easing volatility to support bull trend","Benchmark indices the Sensex and the Nifty extended gains for third straight day on April 23 as fear around West Asia conflict eased and a sharp drop in volatility. Most sectors traded higher, while broader indices outperformed the benchmarks. The Sensex was up 89.83 points or 0.12 percent at 73,738.45, and the Nifty was up 31.60 points or 0.14 percent at 22,368. The market breadth was in favour of gainers — 2,151 shares advanced, 1,353 shares declined, and 89 shares unchanged.

ALSO READ:Experts bet on these 10 stocks that may outperform market with healthy returns The fear gauge India VIX saw its biggest fall in nearly five years, down 18 percent to 10.3. Cooling volatility indicates that worries over West Asia tensions had ebbed, Ajit Mishra, Senior Vice-President of Technical Research at Religare Broking, said. He expects onset of general elections and corporate earnings season to lend support to markets in the near term. ""We expect Nifty to beat 22,600 in the next few days, followed by 22,900-23,000,"" Mishra said.

Hyundai Motor India shares plunge 20% from all-time peak. Will Q3 help turn the tide?,"Despite the GST 2.0 lift-off,Hyundai Motor India’s stock has fallen 20% from the record high it touched in September 2025, as investors reassess the company’s growth outlook amid mixed signals on demand and margin concerns emanating from its newest plant. While analysts continue to forecast steady revenue growth supported by exports, a richer product mix and currency tailwinds, concerns over the limited benefit from the GST rate cut and near-term headwinds have kept investors on edge. Here’s what experts are saying.Has GST 2.0 delivered for Hyundai?InCred Equities does not believe so. The brokerage said the benefit from the lower 18% GST rate is limited to just 30% of Hyundai’s net sales. Strong growth over the last three years in exports, parts and services, and large SUVs has reduced Hyundai’s dependence on products covered under the new GST rate to 30% of net sales value in FY25.With demand sensitivity expected to be higher in low-priced compact cars, InCred believes Hyundai’s sales benefit from the GST rate cut will be limited compared with peers such asMaruti SuzukiandTata Motors. This, it said, could extend the underperformance of Hyundai’s domestic volume growth versus the market leader seen in recent months.On the capacity front, InCred said nearly 30% capacity expansion is likely from the recently commissioned Pune plant. The brokerage expects the facility to initially produce refreshed versions of the Venue and Exter, while a new compact car launch is scheduled for FY27F. An India-dedicated electric vehicle planned for CY27F will also be closely tracked.Live EventsMargins could face pressure in the near term. InCred said the high overheads of the new plant may weigh on EBITDA margins until capacity utilisation improves, even as Hyundai’s margin resilience over the past six months has surprised the brokerage.While InCred raised FY26F–28F EPS estimates for Hyundai by 2 to 7% on favourable INR depreciation, it maintained a cautious stance on valuation.

"Govt, insurers and hospitals line up second consult to offer a healthy cover","MUMBAI/NEW DELHI: Thefinance ministrywill hold a second round of discussions with insurers andhospital groupsaround mid-January to address issues of rising medical inflation and steady increase inhealth insurance premiums, said people familiar with the matter.The meeting will be chaired by financial services secretary M Nagaraju, with representatives from the General Insurance Council, the Association ofHealthcare Providers(India) and senior executives from insurers and hospital chains.""This meeting is to take stock of the proposed measures from the industry to bring down health insurance premiums and ensure more transparency in claim settlement. We will also discuss the role of Policyholders' Education and Protection Fund, which has been envisaged through the Insurance Amendment Act, 2025,"" said a government official, who did not wish to be identified.The talks follow an initial meeting held in November, where the ministry flagged concerns over affordability and asked insurers and hospitals to work towards standardised treatment protocols, uniform hospital empanelment norms and faster, more seamless cashless claim processing. Officials believe these measures are critical to controlling costs and improving the policyholder experience amid increasing claims. It was emphasised that hospitals and insurance companies should work together to ensure transparency and efficiency and make healthcare affordable and accessible for policyholders, said a statement issued by the finance ministry.The ministry has also been examining regulatory options to curb sharp premium increases. One proposal under discussion is mandating prior approval from the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India in cases where insurers seek to raise premiums by more than 10% annually for policyholders, as reported earlier. This is similar to the regulator's January 2025 directive for senior citizens, under which insurers were barred from increasing premiums by more than 10% a year without",2026-01-22,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/govt-insurers-and-hospitals-line-up-second-consult-to-offer-a-healthy-cover/articleshow/126384433.cms,neutral,economictimes,,,,1

Will proposed US tariffs trigger further Indian market decline? Experts weigh in,"Mumbai: India's benchmark indices Thursday fell around 1%, the steepest single-day fall since August, after US President Donald Trump backed a bill proposing 500% tariffs on countries purchasing Russian oil. Analysts said that the steeper proposed tariffs hurt investor sentiment and could lead to further declines.The NSE Nifty fell 263.90 points or 1% at 25,876.85, down. The BSE Sensex ended at 84,180.96, a decline of 780.18 points or 0.9%. With Thursday's decline, both indices have fallen for the fourth straight day, taking the loss tally for the week to 1.8%. ""The talk on higher tariffs unsettles trades for companies and uncertainty is not good for the market sentiment,"" said Siddarth Bhamre, head of research,Asit C MehtaIntermediates. ""The liquidity keeps us afloat but the odds of the markets falling are shorter going forward.""FPIs sold shares worth ₹3,367.12 crore on Thursday, while domestic institutions bought ₹3,701.17 crore. FPIs have sold ₹6,856 crore so far in January.AgenciesAll Eyes on US SCAll eyes are now the US Supreme Court, which on Friday is expected to decide on the legality of Trump's tariffs. If the court strikes down the tariffs, it could lead to a near-term rebound.

Rs 1.4 lakh crore shock! Why Reliance shares are hit in New Year selloff & what Q3 results could change,"Billionaire Mukesh Ambani-ownedReliance Industries Ltd(RIL), India's most valuable listed company, has shed nearly ₹1.4 lakh crore in market capitalization in a brutal start to 2026, with shares down about 7% year-to-date as twin fears around Russian crude exposure and softer retail growth momentum across peers trigger a sharp recalibration of investor expectations.The selloff marks a dramatic reversal for a stock that outperformed theNiftyto rally 29% in 2025. But the mood has soured fast: concerns over refining dependence on Russian crude, coupled with visible weakness in discretionary spending across organized retail peers, have left bulls scrambling for answers as the company prepares to report its December quarter earnings this Friday.Yet brokerages remain largely sanguine, framing 2026 as a ""year of catalysts"" for Reliance, with Q3 results expected to showcase a tale of two businesses: energy shining bright, retail stumbling through a bumpy patch.""RIL's upcoming quarter will see energy shine with retail bumpy,""Morgan Stanley'sMayank Maheshwarisaid. ""Earnings trajectory remains robust and the path for multiple catalysts every quarter is in play. Consumer retail could drag stock performance near term.""Morgan Stanley expects December quarter EBITDA to rise 10% year-on-year, driven by a 16% year-on-year EBITDA growth in the Oil to Chemicals (O2C) segment as the refining upcycle sustains momentum. However, profit growth is expected to be muted at just 1% year-on-year due to capitalization of interest and depreciation expenses, especially for the telecom vertical.Live EventsGoldman Sachsexpects O2C EBITDA to grow 11% quarter-on-quarter and 16% year-on-year as stronger refining earnings more than offset declines in petrochemical earnings.

"HSBC upgrades Hindustan Zinc to Buy ahead of Q3, ups target price for 2 more metal stocks. Check details","Shares ofHindustan Zincclimbed sharply on Monday, gaining over 4% to hit an intraday high of Rs 663 after international brokerage HSBC upgraded the stock to Buy from Hold and raised its target price to Rs 750 per share, implying an 18% upside. The move comes ahead of the company’s Q3 earnings announcement later today.HSBC said it has incorporated updated LME zinc and silver price forecasts, raising its FY2026–28 assumptions by around 5% to 23%. This led to a 12% to 20% increase in EBITDA estimates for FY2027–28. The brokerage now values Hindustan Zinc at 11x FY27E EV/EBITDA, up from 9.5x earlier, placing it at the higher end of its five-year trading range of 5x to 11x. The valuation reflects the company’s strong balance sheet and a stable-to-improving outlook for LME zinc and silver prices. “We see further earnings upside potential from spot LME zinc and silver prices,” HSBC said.Alongside Hindustan Zinc, HSBC has also raised target prices for two other metal stocks,HindalcoandNational Aluminium Company(NALCO).For Hindalco, the brokerage has increased the target price to Rs 1,240 from Rs 1,060, implying a 33% upside, and raised EBITDA estimates by around 7% to 10% for FY2027–28. HSBC said it has factored in higher global LME aluminium and copper price forecasts, increasing FY2026–28 aluminium assumptions by about 5% to 16% and copper forecasts by around 5% to 20%, which drove the roughly 17% upgrade in the target price. The India business is valued at 7x FY27E EV/EBITDA, unchanged, representing a slight premium to its long-term average given the strong aluminium price outlook. Novelis is valued at 6.5x FY27E EV/EBITDA, also unchanged, reflecting a 10% premium to US peers such as Kaiser and Constellium, supported by its scale, diversification and growth capex.For NALCO, HSBC has raised the target price to Rs 420 from Rs 373, implying a 16% upside, after increasing EBITDA estimates by around 16% for FY2027–28 following the incorporation of updated global LME aluminium",2026-01-22,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/hsbc-upgrades-hindustan-zinc-to-buy-ahead-of-q3-ups-target-price-for-2-more-metal-stocks-check-details/articleshow/126674805.cms,neutral,economictimes,,,,1

"ITC, Eternal among 15 stocks in CLSA’s 2026 focus portfolio. Check full list & targets here","Indian equities head into 2026 with a challenging but more balanced setup after the Nifty’s record underperformance in 2025 narrowed India’s valuation premium versus peers, according to CLSA. While absolute index upside may be capped given elevated valuations, CLSA expects improving earnings visibility and compressed stock-level valuations to create bottom-up opportunities. The brokerage prefers large caps with a tilt toward consumption, rate-sensitives, IT and select value plays in 2026, it said. Here are the 15 stocks in the brokerage's 2026 focus portfolio: CLSA has a target price of Rs 1,700 for ICICI Bank, citing easing concerns around management succession and a potential pickup in loan growth. State Bank of India carries a target of Rs 1,170, with CLSA flagging its ability to sustain loan market share and returns as a key driver. IndusInd Bank has a target price of Rs 725, with the brokerage watching progress toward its medium-term return on assets target and benefits from a CV cycle recovery. CLSA has set a target price of Rs 1,814 for Infosys, supported by its high discretionary exposure and expectations of an improving US macro environment. Tech Mahindra has a target of Rs 1,705, with CLSA highlighting sustained revenue and margin expansion driven by internal execution and a stronger second half of FY26. Both stocks remain CLSA’s preferred contrarian IT plays for 2026. CLSA’s portfolio reflects exposure to both Tata Motors entities post-demerger. For Tata Motors PV, the brokerage has a target price of Rs 450, backed by a better domestic passenger vehicle outlook, GST cuts and new launches. CLSA has not assigned a target price for Tata Motors CV, but expects a cyclical upturn driven by rising freight demand, improving utilisation and replacement-led growth. CLSA has a target price of Rs 330 for ONGC, citing the ramp-up of the KG 98/2 cluster, which is expected to boost oil and gas output and strengthen production visibility. NTPC carries a target of Rs 459,",2026-01-22,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/itc-eternal-among-15-stocks-in-clsas-2026-focus-portfolio-check-full-list-targets-here/slideshow/126426910.cms,neutral,economictimes,,,,1

Ahead of Market: 10 things that will decide stock market action on Friday,"The Indian market observed a trading holiday today on account of the Maharashtra Municipal Corporation Elections on Thursday.On Wednesday, the market ended lower, with theSensex and Niftyextending their slide as worries over potential U.S. tariffs and persistent foreign investor outflows outweighed gains in metal and banking stocks.The benchmark BSE Sensex slipped 245 points, or 0.29%, to end at 83,382.71, while the NSE Nifty 50 fell 66.7 points, or 0.26%, to 25,665.60. The decline marked the seventh loss in eight sessions for both indexes, reflecting fragile investor sentiment despite pockets of sectoral strength.Here's how analysts read the market pulse:Domestic markets remained cautious amid lingering uncertainty over the India–US trade deal, with FIIs staying risk-averse, said Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Investments, adding that the restart of negotiations this week has instilled renewed hopes.Live Events""Metals led the rally as prices climbed on expectations of U.S. rate cuts, supported by softer inflation data and safe-haven demand amid geopolitical tensions. Broader markets performed well given selective buying in mid- and small-cap segments. Globally, equities traded mixed as investors awaited the U.S. December PPI and major bank earnings. Looking ahead, focus will shift to Q3 FY26 earnings, where initial IT results were broadly in line with expectations, though bottom-line performance was impacted by one-off costs,"" said Nair.Also read |5 Wall Street moguls who dismissed Bitcoin as a fad — Guess what they’re saying now!US marketsWall Street's main indexes bounced back on ⁠Thursday after a two-day fall, riding a chip-led rally sparked by TSMC's blockbuster results, while investors sifted through earnings from Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs to wrap up big banks' reporting season.Chip stocks such as Nvidia rose 2%, while Broadcom and Micron gained 1.4% and 1.9%, respectively.

China's tech stock boom pushes past economic malaise,"Nearly a year after DeepSeek's AI breakthrough rattled global markets, China is entering 2026 with a fresh wave of technological advances that are powering a stock rally, even as its economy remains fragile.Thanks to fresh progress in sectors from commercial rockets to robotics and flying cars, Chinese tech shares have begun the new year with a bang. An onshore Nasdaq-like tech gauge has shot up almost 13% so far this month, while a measure of Hong Kong-listed Chinese tech firms has climbed nearly 6%. Both have outperformed the Nasdaq 100.Enthusiasm about homegrown technologies has been the single biggest driver of China's equities bull run since April, even as the world's second-largest economy remained mired in a housing slump and anemic consumption. The momentum may gain further support in the coming months as DeepSeek rolls out a new AI model and China unveils a five-year economic blueprint prioritising technological self-reliance.""The stock market is telling us that what China is doing in technology sector is going to be very exciting going forward,"" Mark Mobius, managing director of Mobius Emerging Opportunities Fund, told Bloomberg TV on Friday. ""You must remember China's goal now is to overtake the US in technology, in high-level chips, in all kinds of AI. So the money is going in that direction.""BloombergSince DeepSeek shocked global markets with its cheap and equally well-performing AI models on Jan. 27 last year, fellow Chinese firms have accelerated efforts to develop their own versions. Adoption of generative AI has also surged among the country’s Internet giants from Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. to Tencent Holdings Ltd.Live EventsElsewhere, Chinese robots have competed in marathons, sparred in boxing matches and performed folk dance routines.

Nifty breaks record high twice in 40 days. Will this rally endure or fizzle out again?,"India's benchmark indexNiftyhas scaled fresh record highs twice in just over 40 days, raising a familiar question for investors -- is this rally different from the one that fizzled out earlier, or is another bout of profit-booking around the corner?The benchmark index crossed the 26,300 mark in early January 2026 after first hitting an all-time high in late November, driven by strong performances in banking, auto and energy stocks. This time, however, analysts say the rally is being supported by a healthier mix ofearnings visibility,domestic demandand improving balance sheets rather than just liquidity.According to Sourav Choudhary, Managing Director at Raghunath Capital, the current up-move rests on firmer fundamentals than earlier momentum-led phases.""Unlike past rallies that were largely driven by liquidity and global risk-on sentiment, this one is anchored in earnings growth and macro stability,"" Choudhary said.He pointed out that banks, industrials, manufacturing and capital goods companies are likely to report steadyprofit growth, supported by government capital expenditure and a gradual formalisation of the economy.Live EventsEarnings strength across key sectors has been one of the biggest pillars of support. Financials continue to benefit from improving asset quality and credit growth, while autos and manufacturing have seen stable demand. Infrastructure-linked companies are also reporting strong order books as public spending remains robust.Another key factor has been the steady flow of domestic money into equities. Monthly SIP investments remain elevated, providing a cushion even when foreign portfolio investor flows turn volatile. Analysts say this has reduced the market's dependence on overseas liquidity, making corrections shallower.Khushi Mistry, Research Analyst at Bonanza, said the latest rally was backed by a broad-based sectoral move. ""Around 15 out of 16 sectors advanced during the recent up-move. Banking, auto and energy led from the front, while",2026-01-22,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/nifty-breaks-record-high-twice-in-40-days-will-this-rally-endure-or-fizzle-out-again/articleshow/126365556.cms,neutral,economictimes,,,,1

Jindal Saw shares rally 20% in two sessions on strong Q3FY26 results,"Jindal SAW sharessurged up to 5% on Tuesday to hit an intraday high of Rs 188.38 on the NSE, buoyed by positive investor sentiment after the company’s strong performance in the December quarter (Q3FY26). The stock extended its rally for a second straight session, climbing nearly 20% over the past two trading days.The sharp rise comes following the company’s reporting a robust sequential improvement in earnings, highlighting a recovery in operational performance.Jindal SAWposted a profit after tax (PAT) of Rs 248 crore in Q3FY26, up sharply from Rs 139 crore in the previous quarter, reflecting a robust 78% sequential (QoQ) growth. However, on a year-on-year basis, PAT fell 48.4% from Rs 479.4 crore in Q3FY25, largely due to a high base effect.Revenue from operations mirrored this trend. It increased 17% sequentially to Rs 4,943 crore in Q3FY26 from Rs 4,234 crore in Q2FY26, but declined 6% year-on-year from Rs 5,271 crore in the same quarter last year.Despite the YoY decline, the company noted that operational performance has steadily improved over the past two quarters, indicating a gradual recovery.Live EventsJindal SAW also reported a robust order book of around US$ 1,481 million for its Iron & Steel Pipes and Pellets segment as of Q3FY26. Of the total, Iron & Steel Pipes account for approximately US$ 1,442 million, while the Pellets segment contributes about US$ 39 million. This strong order backlog provides healthy medium-term revenue visibility and is expected to support the company’s business momentum in the coming quarters.The company also made progress on balance-sheet strengthening. Long-term debt declined on both the standalone and consolidated levels.Consolidated long-term debt stood at Rs 6,890 million in December 2025, down from Rs 7,417 million in September 2025.The strong sequential earnings growth, improving operations, robust order book, and debt reduction have boosted investor confidence, driving the recent surge in Jindal SAW’s share price.

"Shriram Finance shares in focus as board mulls Rs 39,618 crore funding from MUFG","Shares ofShriram Financewill be in focus on Thursday, January 8, as the company prepares for anExtraordinary General Meeting(EGM) on January 14 to seekshareholder approvalfor a Rs 39,618 crore (around $4.4 billion)capital infusionfrom Japan’sMUFG Bank. The deal entails a 20% stake dilution through a preferential share allotment and ranks among the largest cross-border investments in India’s financial services sector.Three proxy advisory firms have recommended shareholders vote in favour of all three resolutions linked to the proposal. The first two special resolutions relate to the preferential allotment of a 20% equity stake to MUFG Bank and the grant of special rights to the investor. These resolutions require approval from at least 75% of votes cast.The third resolution concerns a USD 200 million non-compete fee to be paid by MUFG Bank to Shriram Ownership Trust (SOT), the promoter entity. This proposal will be put to vote as an ordinary resolution, with promoters abstaining from voting.Advisory firm Institutional Shareholder Services (ISS) found no concerns with the non-compete fee and clarified that the payment will be made only upon successful completion of the share allotment. ISS added that the fee relates to a genuine restriction preventing promoters from entering competing businesses. Since MUFG Bank pays it directly, not Shriram Finance, it mitigates the risk of value leakage.Another advisory firm, InGovern, also urged shareholders to support the proposal, citing fair pricing, the investor’s strong credentials, and safeguards for Shriram Finance’s core business and brand. InGovern added that the non-compete fee is proportionate to the investment size and includes clearly defined scope and sunset clauses.Live EventsAs of end-September, foreign institutional investors held 49.61% in Shriram Finance, domestic institutional investors 18.65%, promoters 25.39%, and non-institutional public shareholders 6.34%.

The endorsement cheered bulls asEternalshares rallied around 3% to Rs 292.95 on BSE this morning.Zomato’s recent stock correction has been driven by concerns over a near-term slowdown in quick-commerce growth and the implications for its medium-term outlook. In addition, some investors are wary of intensifying competition and its potential impact onBlinkit’s margins.“We disagree with the extent of the bearishness being priced into Zomato's stock, and reiterate our Buy rating with our revised 12m target price of Rs 375 (was Rs 390), implying 33% upside from current levels,” Goldman said, adding thatFollowing the endorsement from Goldman, Eternal shares were up 1.5% at Rs 287.80 on BSE this morning. The brokerage said Blinkit's implied EV/EBITDA on normalised margins (FY30E) at 14x is at the lower end of our India Internet peer group, despite a significantly superior growth profile.“We expect Zomato'sEBITDA growthto be 50%+ YoY at least until FY30E.

Should you buy, sell or hold?","Punjab NationalBank’s shares extended their post-results slide for a second straight session, falling as much as 2% on Tuesday to Rs 125.50 on the BSE, as investors digested margin pressure and a cut in the lender’s net interest margin guidance even as headline profit beat estimates.

For the market, however, the sharper focus has been on weakening margins, softer core operating performance and what brokerages see as limited levers to arrest the decline in net interest margins.Citi's viewCiti saidPNB’s net interest margin contracted 8 basis points quarter-on-quarter to 2.52%, below its estimates, prompting the bank to cut its FY26 NIM guidance to 2.6% from an earlier 2.8-2.9%.While return on assets held up at 1.06%, Citi attributed this to treasury gains, recoveries from written-off accounts and tax reversals rather than core operating strength. The brokerage noted that floating provisions of Rs 9.6 billion were created towards the expected credit loss transition, with credit cost at 39 bps.Live EventsAsset quality continued to improve, with gross NPAs declining 26 bps sequentially to 3.19% and slippages remaining below 0.7%. Loan growth was sustained at about 10% year-on-year, led by MSMEs and corporate loans, and the sanction pipeline remained strong at Rs 21.02 trillion.Citi said it revised FY26 and FY27 earnings upward but maintained its 'Sell' rating, citing persistent margin pressure and limited levers to support NIMs.Morgan Stanley's viewMorgan Stanley highlighted that PNB’s third-quarter profit after tax beat estimates by 12%, driven by higher recoveries and lower provisions. However, it flagged weakness in the core business, with pre-pro",2026-01-22,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/pnb-shares-slide-5-in-2-days-after-q3-results-should-you-buy-sell-or-hold/articleshow/126765975.cms,neutral,economictimes,,,,1

"Silver prices take Rs 5,500 hit, tumble 2% today. Should investors buy this dip?","After opening in the red, silver prices extended losses on January 7, sliding about 2%, or by Rs 5,511, to trade around Rs 2,53,300 per kilogram on the MCX, as investors booked profits a day after the precious metal touched a one-week high. The pullback comes after a stellar run in 2025, during which silver prices surged by as much as 147%. With today’s dip, what should investors do?Ponmudi R, CEO of Enrich Money, said that MCX Silver is trading near Rs 2,58,836, sustaining its bullish channel, with every pullback attracting aggressive buying interest. “Holding above Rs 2,55,000 keeps the upside momentum firmly intact. Sustained strength above Rs 2,59,000 could drive a swift move towards Rs 2,64,000 to Rs 2,75,000, while the Rs 2,55,000 to Rs 2,52,000 band remains a key accumulation zone. Silver continues to outperform as a high-beta play within the broader precious metals uptrend,” he added.The recent rally was driven by strong safe-haven demand following heightened global tensions after the US captured Venezuela’s president. Adding to uncertainty, the US President’s renewed push to assert control over Greenland has intensified frictions with the European Union. Investors are now awaiting US payroll data for further cues on the Federal Reserve’s interest rate outlook.For those already holding silver, experts believe the outlook remains broadly positive, supported by global monetary easing, geopolitical uncertainty and structural demand. However, after the spectacular rally of 2025, prudence suggests a balanced approach, booking partial profits to lock in gains while maintaining core holdings as a hedge against volatility and inflation.“With strong momentum, silver prices could test the $100 per ounce level in 2026,” says Hareesh V of Geojit Investments Ltd. “Technical breakouts, structural supply deficits and surging green-tech and industrial demand are key drivers. While consensus forecasts cluster in the $70 to $90 range, multiple bullish scenarios envision silve",2026-01-22,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/silver-prices-take-rs-5500-hit-tumble-2-today-should-investors-buy-this-dip/articleshow/126388715.cms,neutral,economictimes,,,,1

"Sebi eases technical glitch norms for stock brokers, cuts compliance burden for smaller firms","Capital markets regulator Sebi announced an overhaul of its framework for handling technical glitches in stock brokers'electronic trading systems, a move aimed at improving ease of compliance and reducing regulatory burden, particularly for smaller brokers.In a press release, the market regulator said it had reviewed the existing technical glitch framework following public consultation and feedback from market participants. The revised norms are part of Sebi's broader push to create a more conducive regulatory environment and support ease of doing business for intermediaries in the securities market.One of the key changes is the streamlining of eligibility criteria for the applicability of the technical glitch framework. Under the revised rules, the framework will now apply only to stock brokers with more than 10,000 registered clients.Sebi said this change would exclude smaller brokers with limited business scale and lower dependence on technology, resulting in nearly 60% of stock brokers moving out of the framework and seeing a meaningful reduction in compliance requirements.Sebi has also carved out specific exemptions from the applicability of the technical glitch norms. Glitches that occur outside a broker’s trading architecture, those that do not directly impact trading functionality, and incidents with negligible impact have been exempted from the framework.Live EventsAccording to the regulator, this provides brokers immunity from events beyond their control and from issues that do not affect their ability to offer seamless trading services.Another major change relates to reporting requirements. Sebi has extended the timeline for reporting technical glitches from one hour to two hours, offering brokers greater operational flexibility.The revised framework also takes trading holidays into account while submitting reports and replaces the requirement of reporting to multiple exchanges with a single reporting mechanism through a Common Reporting Platform. This is",2026-01-22,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/sebi-eases-technical-glitch-norms-for-stock-brokers-cuts-compliance-burden-for-smaller-firms/articleshow/126435737.cms,neutral,economictimes,,,,1

"Sensex jumps over 700 pts, Nifty above 25,850 after Infosys earnings push","Indian equities traded higher on Friday, with the Sensex and Nifty buoyed by gains inIT stocksafterInfosysdelivered stronger-than-expected quarterly results and raised its full-year revenue growth guidance.The BSE Sensex climbed 277 points, or 0.33%, to 83,660 in early trade, while the NSE Nifty 50 advanced 66 points, or 0.26%, to 25,731, with Infosys leading the benchmarks higher. At around 10:37 AM, Sensex traded 716 pts or 0.86% higher at 84,098.59, whereas Nifty50 rose 200 pts to 25,866.On the 30-share Sensex, gains were led by Infosys,Tech Mahindra, Mahindra & Mahindra,Kotak Mahindra BankandPower Grid, with those stocks advancing between 1% and 5%.Infosys jumped as much as 5%, lifting the IT index by about 2%, after the company surprised investors by raising its fiscal 2026 revenue outlook. Experts said the software exporter is well-positioned to gain market share, citing stronger artificial-intelligence partnerships and deeper engagement with clients.Broader markets were also slightly higher, with mid-cap shares up 0.2% and small-caps adding 0.1%.Live EventsExpert viewsThere are no triggers to take the market significantly up or down and a directionless drift is the likely trend, said Dr. VK Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist at Geojit Investments, adding that a U.S. Supreme Court ruling, which could have led to sharp volatility in global markets, didn’t materialise and since there is no timeline for a ruling such an event is unlikely to influence the market in the near-term.""The market is likely to respond to the major Q3 results that will continue to flow in. Better-than-expected results will trigger stock-specific action but these are unlikely to take the market as a whole to significantly higher levels. Even minor rallies are likely to be neutralised by FII selling. The increasing short positions being built by FIIs indicate that sustained FII selling is likely to be the near-term trend, till such time we have a trend reversal triggered by positive n",2026-01-22,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/sensex-jumps-over-200-pts-nifty-above-25700-after-infosys-earnings-push/articleshow/126556936.cms,neutral,economictimes,,,,1

Nifty valuations frozen for a year but Q3 earnings season could finally break the spell,"India's benchmark stock indexNifty50has been stuck in avaluationrut for the last 12 months, but a crucial earnings season starting next week could determine whether bulls get the rerating they're betting on or face another round of disappointment in a market where the margin for error has all but vanished.TheNifty's 12-month forward PE multiple stands at 20.4 times, virtually unchanged from a year ago, after two consecutive years of lackluster profit growth. Now, as theQ3 earningsdeluge begins from next week, analysts are hopeful that India Inc can deliver the comeback that could reignite the market.""After two muted years, Nifty earnings are set for a sharp rebound, with consensus placing India among the fastest-growing markets globally,"" said CLSA analyst Vikash Kumar Jain. ""Banks should anchor the recovery, with telecom and metals adding heft. While risks remain, including slower credit growth, NIM compression, tariff delays and INR-driven margin pressures, the earnings tide finally looks poised to turn.""Morgan Stanley's equity strategist Ridham Desai struck an even more bullish note: ""We see a sharp turn inearnings growthover the coming months. India's growth cycle is set to accelerate backed by reflation efforts of the RBI and the government via rate cuts, CRR cut, bank deregulation and liquidity infusion, front loading of capex and a near Rs1.5 trillion in GST rate cuts.""For the first time in nearly five years, Desai noted, equity valuations look favorable relative to short-term interest rates, with the modified earnings yield gap pointing to equity upside.Live EventsIIFL Securitiesechoed the optimism saying that while Nifty PE multiples are almost where they were a year ago, the chances of earnings upgrades are much brighter now, and that Nifty should deliver 15% from here.

RBL Bank shares tank 9% despite 555% jump in Q3 net profit. What should investors do?,"Shares of private sector lenderRBL Banktanked 9% to their day's low of Rs 297 on BSE on Monday despite reporting a massive 555% increase in its net profit to Rs 214 crore in the third quarter of FY26 compared to Rs 33 crore it reported in the same quarter of the previous financial year. On a quarter-on-quarter basis, the lender reported a 20% increase in profitability.The lender earned an interest income of Rs 1,657 crore, marking a 5% increase from Rs 1,585 crore it posted in the corresponding quarter of the previous year. The company’s NIM or net interest margin was 4.63%, lower by 33 basis points from 4.90% it reported in the third quarter of the previous financial year, the company said in a regulatory filing.Asset quality improved during the quarter, with the gross NPA ratio declining to 1.88% as of December 31, 2025, from 2.32% at the end of September 2025. The net NPA ratio also edged lower to 0.55% from 0.57% over the same period. The provision coverage ratio, including technical write-offs, stood at a healthy 93.2%.What are analysts saying?Motilal Oswal has maintained a Buy rating on RBL Bank with a target price of Rs 370, an upside of 14% from current levels. This comes despite the bank reporting an earnings miss due to higher provisions. Pre-provision operating profit (PPoP) was better than expected, supported by strong other income. Business growth remained modest in the quarter; however, management has guided for healthy expansion ahead, with wholesale advances seen growing at 20–25% YoY and retail advances at 25–30% YoY. The bank also plans to scale its unsecured portfolio at a calibrated pace. A comfortable credit–deposit ratio and the proposed capital infusion from Emirates NBD are expected to support improved credit growth. With an aggressive provisioning strategy, asset quality is likely to improve over time, while slippages should decline gradually as conditions in unsecured lending stabilise.

"Budget expectations low, says Jefferies; lists defence capex among 8 measures to watch out for","Budget expectationsfrom the upcomingFY27 Union Budgetremain “low”, withJefferiesarguing thatFinance Minister Nirmala Sitharamanis likely to stick to the fiscal consolidation roadmap while prioritising defence-led capital expenditure and selective consumption support measures.Jefferies expects the Centre to peg the FY27fiscal deficitat around 4.2% of GDP, implying a slower pace of consolidation of roughly 15–20 basis points annually through FY27–31.“Alternatively, the Govt could hold the deficit near 4.4%, signalling a push for near‑term growth—positive for growth/equities but likely to firm up bond yields,” the brokerage noted. India’s debt-GDP ratio, still above pre-Covid levels, is targeted to be reduced by about 5 percentage points by FY31, even as tax revenue growth in FY27 is projected at around 8%, marking a third straight year of sub‑10% growth.A key fiscal support will be another strong transfer from the Reserve Bank of India. Jefferies estimates the FY27 RBI dividend could rise 10–15% to about ₹3 trillion, aided by rupee depreciation, helping offset weak tax buoyancy and keep the deficit target within reach.Capex to turn defence heavyOn expenditure, Jefferies expects overall government capital spending to grow about 12% in FY27 to ₹12.5 trillion, but stresses that “the requirement of a reset in defence capex will take priority, which may grow at a much higher 25%.” With year‑to‑date FY26 defence capex already up 57%, the brokerage sees non‑defence capex growth moderating to the 5–10% range, even as welfare spending edges higher.Live EventsJefferies projects central government capital expenditure on defence to rise towards 1% of GDP by FY31, a level last seen four to five years after the Kargil conflict, and highlights that India’s overall defence spend as a share of GDP still trails peers such as Russia, the US and Pakistan, leaving “headroom to rise.”Pay commission risk and market taxationThe looming 8th Central Pay Commission is another big macro swing fa",2026-01-22,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/budget-expectations-low-says-jefferies-lists-defence-capex-among-8-measures-to-watch-out-for/articleshow/126760197.cms,neutral,economictimes,,,,1

Ixigo shares set for 30% upside? 4 reasons JM Financial upgraded stock to Buy,"The parent company of online travel aggregatorIxigo, Le Travenues Technology's share--- jumped over 7% to an intraday high of Rs 227.50 on January 13 afterJM Financialupgraded the stock to ‘Buy’ and raised its target price to Rs 275 per share. The brokerage’s target implies an upside potential of about 30% from current levels.Here’s the 4 reason driving the bullish outlook:Attractive valuations: In a statement the domestic brokerage said that the recent correction in the stock, down about 20% since early December, appears overdone. While it trimmed its FY26–28E consolidated revenue estimates by 1–4% and EBITDA margins by 22–34 basis points—leading to a 5–7% cut in FY26–28E EBITDA—it believes the recent price decline has largely addressed valuation concerns. The correction, it added, offers an attractive long-term entry point, with the stock now factoring in near-term uncertainties more than warranted while underappreciating its structural strengths and recovery potential.Long term fundamentals remain intact: JM hopes that online travel agencies (OTAs) to benefit from structural tailwinds in India’s travel ecosystem, including improving infrastructure, better connectivity and rising affordability. These drivers are especially strong in tier-2 and smaller cities, where travel demand is growing faster than in tier-1 markets, supported by enhanced multi-modal connectivity. “We believe Ixigo is well positioned to capitalise on these trends over the medium to long term, given its strong brand recall in these markets, effective cross-selling across apps, consistent focus on customer experience and strong adoption of differentiated value-added offerings such as Travel Guarantee, Ixigo Assured and Abhi Assured,"" JM said in a statement.Air disruption overdone: Air industry disruption, primarily in the first half of December 2025, is not a structural issue for OTAs as underlying passenger demand remains strong. Moreover, as stability returns, Ixigo should revert to growing fas",2026-01-22,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/ixigo-shares-set-for-30-upside-4-reasons-jm-financial-upgraded-stock-to-buy/articleshow/126498461.cms,neutral,economictimes,,,,1

Tata Motors PV shares tumble over 3% as JLR Q3 volumes slump after massive cyber attack,"Shares ofTata Motors Passenger Vehiclesfell 3.5% to an intraday low of Rs 360.25 on the BSE on Tuesday, January 6, after its luxury armJaguar Land Rover(JLR) reported a sharp year-on-year decline in wholesale and retail volumes for the third quarter of FY26, impacted by a cyber incident last year, one of biggest high-profile cases attacks.JLR reported wholesale volumes of 59,200 units in Q3FY26, a steep decline of 43.3% compared with the same period last year. Retail sales for the quarter stood at 79,600 units, down 25.1% year-on-year. The company said volumes were adversely affected as production only returned to normal levels by mid-November following the cyber incident, with additional time required to distribute vehicles globally after production resumed.The automaker noted that both wholesale and retail volumes declined on a quarter-on-quarter as well as year-on-year basis due to these operational challenges. The impact was further compounded by the ongoing planned wind-down of legacy Jaguar models ahead of the launch of the new Jaguar range, which continued to weigh on volumes through the quarter, in line with expectations.Sensex, Nifty today: Catch all the LIVE stock market action hereAdditionally, JLR highlighted that incremental US tariffs affecting exports to the US market also contributed to the pressure on volumes during the quarter.Live EventsDespite the overall volume decline, the company saw an improvement in its product mix. Higher-margin models — Range Rover, Range Rover Sport and Defender — accounted for 74.3% of total wholesale volumes in Q3FY26. This compares with 70.3% in the year-ago period, though it was lower than the 76.7% contribution seen in the previous quarter.JLR said it is reporting its wholesale and retail sales for the three months ended December 31, 2025, and reiterated that the operational disruptions were largely timing-related.JLR is scheduled to report its full financial results for the third quarter of FY26 in February 2026.(Di",2026-01-22,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/tata-motors-pv-shares-in-focus-as-jlr-q3-volumes-slump-after-massive-cyber-attack/articleshow/126364399.cms,neutral,economictimes,,,,1

Attractive valuations are also adding to the appeal of state-run companies, according to Smartsun Capital Pte and DRChoksey FinServ.Key gauges tracking state-owned firms have been steady this year, while the benchmark is down about 3.4%.

Basmati rice exporters' shares in focus after Trump slaps 25% tariff on Iran-linked trade,"Leading shares ofbasmati rice exporters—LT Foods,KRBL, andChaman Lal Setia Exports— remained in focus on Tuesday (January 13) after US President Donald Trump announced 25% tariff on any country trading with Iran.“Effective immediately, any country that does business with the Islamic Republic of Iran will face a 25% tariff on all trade with the United States,” Trump wrote on Truth Social, adding that the order is “final and conclusive.""Also read:IT Q3 earnings season begins on a strong note as TCS, HCL Tech top estimatesThis comes amid the rising tensions over Iran’s internal crackdown on protests and comes amid warnings of possible military action, including air strikes.The move, which takes immediate effect, is expected to heighten concerns amongIndian exporters, given Iran’s significant role as a key buyer of Indian basmati rice.Live EventsIran is one of the largest importers of Indian basmati rice, both in terms of volume and value. Exporters such as KRBL, LT Foods, andChaman Lal Setiahave traditionally had meaningful exposure to the West Asian market, including Iran, making them particularly sensitive to geopolitical developments and shifts in trade policy involving the region.The newly announced tariff has raised concerns about potential trade disruptions and indirect effects on Indian exporters, particularly if the move influences global trade dynamics or triggers retaliatory measures.White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt confirmed that air strikes remained one of the ""many, many options on the table.""The diplomatic engagement between the US and Iran reportedly remains open, with a special envoy from the Trump administration noting a softer tone from Tehran behind closed doors.(Disclaimer: Recommendations, suggestions, views and opinions given by the experts are their own.

Tata Teleservices shares slide 6% in 2 days after Q3 results. Here’s why,"Tata Teleservices(Maharashtra) shares extended their post-earnings slide on Wednesday, taking the two-day decline to more than 6%, as investors looked past a sharp narrowing of losses and focused instead on a double-digit drop in revenue and a deteriorating technical picture.Shares of Tata Teleservices (Maharashtra) fell as much as 3.1% on Wednesday to Rs 42.22 on the BSE. The stock had already declined about 3% on Tuesday after the company reported its December-quarter results, taking the cumulative fall since the earnings announcement to 6.3%.Thetelecom servicesprovider reported a net loss of Rs 150.43 crore for the quarter ended December 31, 2025, significantly narrower than the Rs 315.11 crore loss a year earlier. But revenue from operations declined 11.56% year-on-year to Rs 294.31 crore, unsettling investors worried about growth sustainability even as losses shrink.While the sharp reduction in losses offered some comfort, the market reaction suggested that investors were more concerned about the top-line trajectory. Sales fell from Rs 332.77 crore in the year-ago quarter, reflecting the pressure on the company’s core business despite ongoing efforts to reposition itself.Tata Teleservices(Maharashtra) has been transitioning away from consumer mobility services to an enterprise-focused model underTata Tele Business Services, offering connectivity, cloud, cybersecurity, Internet of Things and collaboration solutions. The strategy targets higher-margin business clients, particularly small and medium enterprises and large corporations, but the latest numbers raised questions about the pace at which this shift is translating into revenue growth.Live EventsBearish technical signals add pressureThe stock’s technical indicators added to the negative sentiment. Tata Teleservices (Maharashtra) is trading below all eight of its key simple moving averages, from the 5-day to the 200-day, pointing to persistent weakness across short-term and long-term charts.The Relative Str",2026-01-22,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/tata-teleservices-shares-slide-6-in-2-days-after-q3-results-heres-why/articleshow/126929793.cms,neutral,economictimes,,,,1

Insurance firms cut stakes in these 10 stocks during December quarter,"A decrease in insurance shareholding indicates that insurance companies have reduced their stakes in a specific company during the current quarter compared to the previous one. In the Nifty 500 segment, we identified the top 10 stocks that experienced a decline in insurance shareholding from the September 2025 quarter to the December 2025 quarter, based on the available shareholding data for December, according to the StocksEdge shareholding scan.This decline often suggests waning confidence among insurers in the company’s performance or outlook, potentially signalling negative market sentiment. It may also reflect a strategic shift in investment priorities, as insurers seek to reallocate funds to more promising opportunities. Insurance shareholding declined to 9.4% in the December 25 quarter from 10.76% in September 25. Insurance holding eased to 7.59% in the December 25 quarter from 8.38% in September 25. Insurance stake reduced to 3.2% in the December 25 quarter from 3.97% in September 25. Insurance ownership slipped to 4.8% in the December 25 quarter from 5.49% in September 25. Insurance holding fell to 3.31% in the December 25 quarter from 3.99% in September 25. Insurance stake dropped to 8.34% in the December 25 quarter from 9.02% in September 25.

An emerging markets supercycle has just begun: Shuli Ren,"Areemerging marketsjust a one-trick pony? After a stellar 2025, risk-averseinvestorsare getting cautious. After all, this asset class has been an underdog for such a long time. Since 2010, the benchmarkMSCI Emerging Markets Indexhas not outperformed its US counterpart for two consecutive years.BloombergTradersshould keep calm and carry on. There are good reasons to believe that emerging markets have entered a yearslong supercycle. The mechanisms that underpinned 2025’s outperformance, such as a weak dollar, benign globaleconomic growthand investors’ desire to diversify internationally, continue to be present. But more importantly, new investment possibilities are opening up following an eventful January.First, is it time to stockpile commodities? If one consequence of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine is central banks building up gold reserves and diversifying from Treasuries, then President Donald Trump’s oil grab in Venezuela and subsequent threats to take minerals-rich Greenland “the hard way” will only firm up countries’ urge to boost inventories needed for high-end manufacturing, such as robotics and electric vehicles, as well as AI data centers. Indeed, the more bellicose Trump gets, the stronger gold, silver, copper, or nickel rally.It’s a bullish signal for the resource-rich Global South if everyone wants more of these future-facing commodities. Historically, the stock performance of Chile, the world’s top copper producer, is closely linked to the metal’s price. By the same token, Brazil’s market valuation tracks that of industrial metals and South Africa’s to gold.BloombergSecond, new frontiers are emerging. Just two weeks ago, it was inconceivable that Venezuela, once a big borrower in the global sovereign bond market that defaulted on its obligations in 2017 after US-imposed sanctions, could be back in the fold. Now, Wall Street is discussing the possibility of a debt restructuring.Live EventsAnd how about Saudi Arabia, the oil-rich regional superpower that on",2026-01-22,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/an-emerging-markets-supercycle-has-just-begun-shuli-ren/articleshow/126537289.cms,neutral,economictimes,,,,1

"Asian stocks drop after Wall Street, bonds steady","Asian stocksretreated on Wednesday, tracking a selloff on Wall Street as theUS-Europe trade conflictover Greenland and a turmoil inbond marketsrattled investors. Gold hit a fresh record.Equities opened lower in Japan, South Korea and Australia after the S&P 500 posted its steepest loss since October, wiping out year-to-date gains. The VIX volatility gauge surged above 20 for the first time since November. Futures contracts for US benchmarks edged higher early Wednesday.Investors will also be closely monitoring Japanese bonds after Finance Minister Satsuki Katayama called for calm amongst market participants following a selloff that pushed yields to all-time highs.Treasuries steadied in Asian trading on Wednesday. Long-term US yields had hit a four-month high in the US session with the 30-year gaining eight basis points as investors reacted to a rout in Japanese bonds and news that a Danish pension fund was planning to exit Treasuries. A Bloomberg gauge of the dollar was a touch lower Wednesday.The moves underscored mounting investor unease over erratic US foreign policy, with global funds pulling back from American assets. President Donald Trump’s threat to impose tariffs on European nations that rejected his proposal to purchase Greenland has helped inject fresh volatility into markets, and forced investors to reassess US stability as a safe haven.Live Events“Tariff War 2.0, or Territory War 1.0 if you prefer, is in full swing and has potential to cause significant near-term market disruptions,” said Victoria Greene at G Squared Private Wealth. “A lot depends on how the next few weeks play out. So, we are not ‘panic selling,’ but watching carefully and ready for volatility.”BloombergThe global market selloff on Tuesday was first triggered by domestic issues in Japan, where yields on 30-year debt surged over a quarter percentage point on concerns about the Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi’s plans to cut taxes and boost spending.

Tech Mahindra Q3 Preview: Profit set to climb despite one-time labour code charges,"Tech Mahindrais expected to report steadyrevenue performancealong with improvedprofitabilityin the December quarter, supported by margin expansion and cost optimisation measures. As per the average estimates of six brokerages, the company’s revenue is projected to rise by around 7% year-on-year in Q3, while profit after tax is likely to jump about 40% YoY.The estimated PAT growth does not account for any potential impact from labour code-related provisions. However, given the strong scale of growth projected by brokerages, Tech Mahindra is likely to report profit expansion, setting it apart from many of its larger IT peers.Revenue outlook: Modest growth, led by enterprise tractionMost brokerages anticipate that Tech Mahindra’s revenue growth will remain modest on a sequential basis, pointing to a slow and steady recovery rather than a sharp bounce-back. HSBC expects dollar revenue to rise by about 0.5% quarter-on-quarter, even as constant currency movements pose a 30-basis-point headwind.Nomura and Centrum Broking similarly project sequential growth of around 0.4–0.5% in constant currency terms, supported by improving momentum in BFSI, communications, and enterprise segments.Live EventsNuvama is relatively more upbeat, forecasting constant currency growth of approximately 0.7% quarter-on-quarter, aided by a seasonally stronger retail performance and incremental contributions from telecom and manufacturing.Kotak Equities expects 0.5% constant currency growth, supported by retail and the Comviva business, while also flagging signs of gradual stabilisation across key verticals.Margins: Expansion remains the key themeMargin expansion remains the key focus for investors this quarter. Most brokerages expect Tech Mahindra to deliver a notable sequential improvement in EBIT margins, driven by cost optimisation measures, operational efficiencies, and a favourable currency environment.Centrum Broking expects EBIT margins to rise by around 45 basis points quarter-on-quarter, d",2026-01-22,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/tech-mahindra-q3-preview-profit-set-to-climb-despite-one-time-labour-code-charges/articleshow/126538457.cms,neutral,economictimes,,,,1

The brokerage is urging investors to focus on large, domestically oriented stocks such asHDFC Bank,ICICI Bank,Maruti Suzuki, Mahindra & Mahindra,Reliance IndustriesandBharti Airtelas policy support, easing financial conditions and a consumption recovery begin to show through.BNP Paribas said in its India Strategy 2026 report that it expects the Nifty 50 to deliver about 15% upside from current levels, with large caps continuing to outperform mid- and small-cap stocks as valuations remain more comfortable at the top end of the market.The brokerage said policy actions taken in 2025, including income tax cuts, a GST rate reduction and a cumulative 125 basis point cut in interest rates, are starting to show early positive results and should lift growth and earnings in 2026, particularly for domestically oriented sectors. “Our confidence on FY27 earnings has increased and we expect Nifty 50 returns to be earnings led,” the report said.Largecaps, domestic sectors in focusBNP Paribas said it is more positive on private sector banks, passenger vehicle makers, telecom companies and consumer staples, arguing that these sectors are best placed to benefit from improving consumption, easier liquidity and operating leverage. It expects largecap stocks to continue outperforming, noting that mid and smallcap indices still trade at significant premiums to the Nifty 50 despite recent underperformance.In financials, the brokerage said it expects a rebound in earnings momentum for private sector banks in FY27, supported by credit growth, GST rationalisation benefits and strong balance sheets. Its top bank picks include HDFC Bank, ICICI Bank andAxis Bank, whileSBI Life Insuranceis its preferred name in insurance.Live EventsIn autos, BNP Paribas said reduced GST rates have lowered on-road prices and boosted demand, setting the stage",2026-01-22,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/nifty-to-reach-29500-by-2026-end-bnp-paribas-says-backing-hdfc-bank-maruti-suzuki-among-top-bets/articleshow/126433113.cms,neutral,economictimes,,,,1

Groww shares rise nearly 5% in just two sessions. What’s triggering the rally?,"Shares ofBillionbrains Garage Ventures, the parent company ofGroww, rallied another 2% to their day’s high of Rs 166 on Tuesday, after Kotak Institutional Equities initiated coverage with a Buy rating and a target price of Rs 190 per share. This implies an upside potential of 16.5% from current market levels.The brokerage expects FY26E to see largely flat earnings, followed by strong growth of around 35% in FY27E and about 25% in FY28E. This growth is likely to be driven by a sharp ramp-up in underpenetrated segments such as marginal trading facility (MTF), commodities, incremental contribution from wealth revenues through both organic and inorganic avenues, and operating leverage that should support margin expansion.Groww is expected to deliver a 20% revenue CAGR over FY2026–28E, supported by a business model designed for high profitability. EBITDA margins are likely to expand to around 65% by FY2028E from about 60% in FY2025, driven by scale benefits and a steady decline in cost intensity. Margin expansion will also be supported by new, higher-margin revenue streams such as MTF and commodities.Further, Kotak added that marketing costs, as a percentage of revenue, have fallen sharply to 12% in FY2025 from 21% in FY2023 and are projected to ease further to around 10% by FY2028E. Strong internal cash generation is expected to comfortably fund growth in MTF and on-balance sheet lending, supporting capital efficiency. The balance sheet remains under-leveraged, with a healthy return on equity of around 25%.Groww’s product‑first DNA, organic acquisition engine and tech focus have created a platform that scales faster and monetizes better than peers while continually broadening revenue streams beyond turnover‑linked broking, Kotak said in a note dated January 9. Groww’s journey so far demonstrates consistent share gains across products, pricing power, improving unit economics and a high-potential wealth pivot. Execution on wealth monetization is critical to sustain platfo",2026-01-22,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/groww-shares-rise-2-extend-gains-for-second-session-whats-triggering-the-rally/articleshow/126496614.cms,neutral,economictimes,,,,1

Hindustan Zinc shares rise 3% as silver hits fresh record high over $83. What should investors do?,"Shares ofHindustan Zincrallied as much as 3.2% to an intraday high of Rs 627 on Monday, January 12, tracking a sharp surge in silver prices after the metal hit a fresh record high of $83.56 per troy ounce.Safe-haven demand has strengthened in recent sessions amid escalating tensions between the US and Iran, along with reports that Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell was threatened with criminal indictment by the Trump administration over his Congressional testimony.At around 11:05 am, silver March futures on the MCX were trading 3.9% higher at Rs 2,62,650 per kilogram, up Rs 9,925 from the previous close. With the latest rally,Hindustan Zinc shareshave gained about 6% over the past two sessions.Hindustan Zinc ranks among the world’s top five silver producers, with an annual capacity of around 800 tonnes. Silver is a key earnings driver for the company, contributing about 38% to its EBIT.What should investors do?Live EventsFrom a technical standpoint, the picture remains constructive, says Ajit Mishra, SVP atReligareBroking. The stock has resumed its broader uptrend after a brief consolidation, and rising volumes confirm the strength of the move. As long as Hindustan Zinc holds above the Rs 560–580 zone, the trend remains positive, with potential upside toward Rs 650–680. On the downside, Rs 540–550 is seen as a key medium-term support.Last month, international brokerage firm Jefferies initiated coverage with a Buy call and a target price of Rs 660 per share. That’s an upside of 9% from current market levels. To be sure, the stock has already risen 11% in the last 1 month.Hindustan Zinc stands out as a key beneficiary of rising silver and zinc prices, supported by its first-decile zinc mining costs. While volume growth is expected to remain modest, earnings are projected to expand sharply, with EPS growth of 22% in FY26 and 29% in FY27, followed by a further 7% increase in FY28, Jefferies said in a note.Hindustan Zinc has seen a sharp improvement in cost efficiency,",2026-01-22,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/hindustan-zinc-shares-rise-3-as-silver-hits-fresh-record-high-over-83-what-should-investors-do/articleshow/126476455.cms,neutral,economictimes,,,,1

This was on the back of nearly 213% jump in stock price in this period. In this context, Coal India's subsidiary,Bharat Coking CoalLtd (BCCL), is approaching the market for funds, and investors will find out whetherBCCLcan replicate the parent's success.What worked for Coal India over the last five years?The rally in Coal India was not driven by a single event. It was built on a combination of commodity-cycle support, stronger domestic coal offtake, and a market re-rating that rewarded cash-rich PSUs.First, the broader coal cycle turned favourable.India's power demandremained resilient through most of this period, and the policy priority shifted toward ensuring domestic coal availability and reducing imports.Coal India, which supplies the bulk of the country's coal needs, naturally benefited as coal production rose and the supply chain stabilised. Government data shows all-India coal production rose sharply in FY25 versus FY23, highlighting the multi-year push to raise domestic output.Coal India's earnings and cash flows also improved materially during the upcycle, helped by better realisations and a tighter domestic supply-demand balance. The stock also developed a strong ""cash yield"" identity in portfolios, where investors increasingly treated it as a high-cash, high-payoutPSUthat can return a meaningful share of profits to shareholders, especially in strong pricing periods.Live EventsBroker notes through the cycle repeatedly flagged the importance of e-auction dynamics and realisation trends for profitability, and the market typically priced that optionality into the stock during stronger phases.The PSU re-rating theme also played a role. From 2022 onward, several state-owned companies saw higher investor participation as balance sheets improved",2026-01-22,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/coal-indias-five-year-run-creates-rs-1-8-lakh-crore-wealth-for-investors-can-bharat-coking-coal-match-it/articleshow/126406410.cms,neutral,economictimes,,,,1

"Reliance Industries shares slip 2%, down 8% in 2026. Time to buy before Q3?","Shares of Mukesh Ambani-ledReliance Industriesslipped as much as 2.3% to an intraday low of Rs 1,448 in afternoon trade on January 13, extending the stock’s weak run so far in 2026, during which it has already declined over 8%. The oil-to-telecom conglomerate is scheduled to announce its December-quarter (Q3FY26) results on Friday, January 16. Can investors buy this dip?What do technicals indicate?“Reliance Industries is currently undergoing a corrective phase after posting a new record high near the Rs 1,610 mark, with the stock slipping below its short-term 20-day and medium-term 100-day exponential moving averages, signalling a loss of near-term momentum,” says Ajit Mishra, SVP atReligareBroking.Mishra believes this decline is part of a healthy consolidation within a broader uptrend rather than a trend reversal. Volumes during the pullback remain moderate, suggesting the absence of panic selling. The Rs 1,380–1,440 zone is expected to provide strong support, while the Rs 1,520–1,600 band is likely to act as a near-term resistance. Investors with a medium-to-long-term horizon may consider using this phase to accumulate on declines near the support zone.Echoing the same view, Aakash Shah Technical Research Analyst at Choice Equity Broking saidReliance Industriesis currently witnessing a healthy pullback within its broader uptrend. After a strong rally from the October lows, the stock faced rejection near the Rs 1,580–1,600 resistance zone and has retraced toward its key moving averages. Price is now testing the 100 EMA and is approaching the 200 EMA, which act as crucial medium- to long-term support levels.Live EventsThe 1,440–1,450 zone, coinciding with the 200 EMA, is an important demand area. As long asRelianceholds above this support, the stock may stabilize and attempt a rebound. However, failure to hold the 200-day EMA could lead to further downside toward the Rs 1,400 level, which emerges as the next key support zone on the chart.

"Global money returns to US debt, lifting treasury holdings to all-time peak","Foreign holdings ofU.S. Treasuriesclimbed to a record high in November, rebounding after two consecutive monthly declines as investor confidence improved following the end of the longest federal government shutdown in U.S. history, according to data cited by Reuters.The U.S. government shut down on October 1 and remained closed for a record 43 days before reopening on November 12, after President Donald Trump signed a funding bill into law. The resolution of the shutdown appeared to ease concerns among global investors, supporting renewed demand forU.S. government debt.Holdings of U.S. Treasuries by foreign investors rose to an all-time high of $9.355 trillion in November, up from $9.243 trillion in October, Treasury Department data released on Thursday showed. On a year-on-year basis, foreign-owned Treasuries were up 7.2%, Reuters reported.Japan, the United Kingdom, Belgium and Canada led the increase in holdings. Japan remained the largest non-U.S. holder of Treasuries, with its portfolio rising to $1.202 trillion in November. This marked Japan’s highest level since July 2022 and extended an 11-month streak of increases in its Treasury holdings, according to Reuters.The United Kingdom, the second-largest foreign holder, also increased its exposure, with holdings rising to $888.5 billion, about 1.2% higher than in October. The UK is widely viewed as a key custody hub for global investors and often reflects hedge fund activity, though such funds also route investments through jurisdictions such as the Cayman Islands and the Bahamas, Reuters noted.Live EventsCanada posted one of the sharpest monthly increases, boosting its Treasury holdings by 13% to a record $472.2 billion in November. This represented a significant reversal from April, when Canadian holdings fell sharply after the U.S. imposed tariffs on Canadian steel, aluminium and automobiles, according to Reuters.In contrast, China continued to reduce its exposure to U.S. government debt.

Cupid bounces back 11% after two-day slump amid healthy Q3 momentum,"Shares ofCupidstaged a strong recovery on Tuesday, rebounding as much as 11% to touch an intraday high of Rs 433, after witnessing a steep correction over the past two trading sessions. The bounce comes after the stock had declined nearly 25% cumulatively, reflecting renewed buying interest following the recent sell-off.The sharp recovery appears to be driven byshort coveringand renewed confidence among investors in the company’s long-term fundamentals.Cupid shareshad earlier plunged nearly 20% on January 2, prompting the company to issue a clarification to stock exchanges.

It comprises chairpersons of the Standing Committee on Technology (SCOT) of MIIs, senior officials from stock brokers and registrars and transfer agents (RTAs), as well as experts from the technology and securities market ecosystem.The move comes against the backdrop of the growing role of digital systems in market operations, surveillance, risk management, investor protection and regulatory oversight. Sebi said the Working Group will take a holistic and forward-looking view on the adoption of emerging technologies by MIIs, including artificial intelligence and machine learning (AI/ML), distributed ledger technology, cloud computing, SupTech and RegTech solutions, tokenisation and quantum-safe systems.Sebi said the initiative is aimed at ensuring that the Indian securities market remains resilient, future-ready and globally competitive, while aligning with India’s long-term vision of a digitally empowered and developed economy.The proposed technology roadmap is expected to guide MIIs such as stock exchanges, clearing corporations and depositories in strengthening their technological capabilities and regulatory preparedness over the coming decade.Live EventsIn another major development, the securities market watchdog allowed stock brokers to undertake activities under the regulatory framework of other financial regulators, a move aimed at improvingease of doing business.

Oil climbed as protests in Iran intensified.Shares in Australia and South Korea and equity index futures for Hong Kong all gained, taking their guide from the S&P 500, which climbed 0.6% on Friday to close at an all-time high. US equity futures edged lower. Japanese financial markets are shut Monday for a holiday, which means there will be no trading of cash US Treasuries in Asia.The rally in US equities Friday followed largely benign employment data that showed slightly fewer workers were added to the economy than economists forecast, while the jobless rate edged down to 4.4%. Separately, the US Supreme Court failed to weigh in on President Donald Trump’s tariffs, pushing into the future one risk hanging over markets.The dollar edged lower in Asia after Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said the US central bank had been served grand jury subpoenas from the Justice Department threatening a criminal indictment related to his June congressional testimony on renovations of the Fed’s headquarters.Gains for stocks in recent days underscore a fragile calm across global markets despite geopolitical uncertainty from Caracas to Tehran, lingering questions over Washington’s tariffs, and signs the dominance of US mega-cap tech stocks may be waning.Live EventsOil advanced Monday as Iran intensified a crackdown on protests across the country.

"Jio IPO may re-rate Bharti Airtel, says Jefferies; raises target price","Jio’s planned mega IPO in the first half of 2026 could turn into an important re‑rating catalyst for Bharti Airtel, withJefferiesarguing that tariff hikes and higher sector weight in indices will work in Bharti’s favour rather than against it. The brokerage has raised its target price onBharti Airtelto Rs 2,760, implying about 32% upside from current levels and reiterating the stock as its top pick in the Indian telecom industry.Billionaire Mukesh Ambani had last year guided to listing Jio Platforms Ltd (JPL) in the first half of the calendar year 2026. Analysts say that it could largely be an offer for sale by financial investors, while strategic shareholders such asReliance, Meta, and Google are expected to stay invested.Jefferies argues that once Jio is listed, public market scrutiny will sharpen the operator’s focus on monetisation and returns, making fresh mobile tariff hikes in 2026 more, not less, likely.According to Jefferies’ sensitivity work, a 10–20% tariff increase is needed in FY27 for Jio’s equity valuation to move closer to Bharti’s and to deliver a double‑digit internal rate of return to existing private‑equity investors. Without such hikes, Jio’s FY27 EBITDA could be about 14% lower at around US$8.5 billion, capping investor IRRs at roughly 6–8%, versus a potential 8–14% IRR if tariffs are raised and the stock commands 12–15 times EV/EBITDA.Why Bharti may re‑rate alongside JioJefferies argues that Jio’s IPO is unlikely to act as an overhang for Bharti, citing the stock’s 32% gain in 2025 despite more than $5 billion of promoter share sales.Live EventsInstead, with Bharti’s India (ex‑towers) business already trading around 13 times EV/EBITDA, the brokerage expects Jio to be priced off Bharti’s multiples, leaving limited room for Bharti to de‑rate and opening scope for a further re‑rating as the listing approaches.Jefferies estimates that once Jio is included in major benchmarks with a roughly 33% free float, the neutral weight of telecom in headline",2026-01-22,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/jio-ipo-may-re-rate-bharti-airtel-says-jefferies-raises-target-price/articleshow/126407713.cms,neutral,economictimes,,,,1

"ECM pipeline strong, rupee likely oversold say Citi bankers","India's equity capital market (ECM) is expected to remain robust in 2026 following a strong pipeline in 2025 led by initial public offers, as private equity firms and foreign controlling shareholders look to cash out, taking advantage of high valuations in the market, top bankers from Citibank said on Thursday.The rupee, which touched record lows in 202,5 is also likely ""oversold"" due to the uncertainty of US tariffs and is likely to regain its losses during the year, the bankers said without giving a level for the rupee.Rob Chan, head of ECM syndicate for Asia at Citi, said he expects the IPO market to be ""very active"" in 2026.""Valuations are high, which will lead to ECM activity with a lot of private equity, shareholder promoters and foreign controlling shareholders likely to cash in. We expect a $15 to $20 billion in 2026, which will become bigger with a lot of high-profile transactions expected as investor appetite remains strong, especially in domestic and retail segments,"" Chan said.Last year was one of the busiest in the primary market, with about Rs 1.8 lakh crore raised, led by top financial sector names likeTata Capital,HDB Financial Servicesand also large offers for sale byLG Electronics IndiaandICICI Prudential AMC.Live Events2025 was also a year of the rupee's weakness, with the Indian currency falling below the Rs 91 per dollar mark amid geopolitical volatilities as the Trump administration imposed a 50% tariff on imports from India due to the country's past purchases of Russian oil.Nitesh Dugar, head of debt capital markets, South and Southeast Asia at Citibank, said the rupee could turn the corner this year as more clarity emerges on tariffs.""The currency is probably a bit oversold thw tariff uncertainty is predominantly media-fuelled. Negotiations are ongoing, and as the reality of what happens emerges, the bias could be towards appreciation,"" Dugar said without giving a level for the rupee.Forecasts revealed earlier for the year show that Citibank",2026-01-22,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/ecm-pipeline-strong-rupee-likely-oversold-say-citi-bankers/articleshow/126544403.cms,neutral,economictimes,,,,1

Dalal Street Week Ahead: Nifty tests key support levels as volatility rises,"The markets saw a decisive breakdown from the 500-point trading range (26,200- 25,700) after a period of consolidation, ending the week on a negative note. Throughout the week,Niftytraded with a clear downward bias, oscillating within a range of 750 points between 26,373 and 25,623. It was the only major global equity index to end in the red, weighed down by rising uncertainty around US trade tariffs and a deferred Supreme Court decision, now expected on January 14.India VIX spiked 16.51% for the week to 10.93, reflecting heightened caution. As a result, Nifty ended the week with a loss of 645.25 points or -2.45%.The current technical structure signals a potential pause in the prevailing uptrend as the index has closed below the lower edge of the 500-point trading range. The close below the 20-week moving average (25,579) would end up in some incremental weakness. Markets remain vulnerable to further pressure, especially amid a combination of domestic consolidation and global risk events. A breach below the current support region could deepen the corrective move, while a bounce back above 25,850–25,900 would be essential to regain strength.ETMarkets.comThe coming week may open on a tentative note, likely influenced by further developments from the US. Initial resistance is expected at 25,900 and then 26,100, while immediate support lies at 25,500, followed by a more crucial zone near 25,300. A failure to defend 25,300 could attract incremental weakness.Live EventsThe weekly RSI stands at 53.16 and has marked a fresh 14-period low; it remains neutral without any divergence against price. However, its flattening near the midline suggests waning momentum. The MACD has shown a bearish crossover with the MACD line now below its signal line, accompanied by a widening negative histogram, reinforcing signs of a developing downside. No strong candlestick reversal pattern was observed on the weekly timeframe, but the long black candle indicates negative sentiment.From a patte",2026-01-22,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/dalal-street-week-ahead-with-momentum-fading-can-nifty-defend-25300/articleshow/126452239.cms,neutral,economictimes,,,,1

"Nomura initiates coverage on ITC Hotels, IHCL with Buy rating. Check target price, upside potential","International brokerage firm Nomura has initiated coverage on two hospitality stocks -ITC Hotelsand Tata Group-ownedIndian Hotels Company(IHCL), with a Buy rating citing robust growth prospects in the coming quarters.With a price target of Rs 230 forITCHotels, analysts imply an upside potential of 20% from current market levels. For Indian Hotels, the foreign brokerage has pegged the target at Rs 830, forecasting an upside potential of over 22% from the previous close of Rs 678.For ITC, Nomura cites strong visibility on high single-digit growth in revenue per available room (RevPAR), driven by resilient average room rate growth and improving occupancy at recently opened assets. The brokerage expects continued RevPAR gains to translate into meaningful operating margin expansion and a stronger cost structure, bringing the company closer to peers in the luxury hospitality segment.Nomura also sees scope for improvement in return on invested capital asITC Hotelsexpands room inventory through its managed-keys strategy and as its Sri Lanka assets, including ITC Ratnadipa and Sapphire Residences, gain traction. Overall, Nomura forecasts consolidated revenue and EBITDA CAGRs of 15% and 18% respectively, over FY25–FY28, along with robust annual cash generation of Rs 800-1,000 crore, which could support inorganic growth opportunities. The stock is valued at 23x FY28 EV/EBITDA, implying a 10% discount to theIndian Hotelscompany, which trades at 26x FY28 EV/EBITDA.As for IHCL, Nomura says average daily rate (ADR) growth is supported by robust demand and a relatively low ADR base in dollar terms. The brokerage also highlights improving the quality of earnings and return on invested capital as IHCL expands largely through management fee arrangements and its capital-light Ginger model. Nomura believes the company is well placed to meet or exceed its 2030 targets for revenue, ROCE and portfolio size. It expects revenue and EBITDA to grow at 15% and 16% CAGRs, respectively, over FY25",2026-01-22,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/nomura-initiates-coverage-on-itc-hotels-ihcl-with-buy-rating-check-target-price-upside-potential/articleshow/126518368.cms,neutral,economictimes,,,,1

"Credit demand zooms as policy eases, outstanding bank credit crossed Rs 200 lakh cr for the first time on Dec 31, 2025","Mumbai: A reduction in Goods and Services Tax, monetary policy easing and a rise in investment intentions are beginning to reflect in credit demand, which rose 14.5% on a year on year (y-o-y)basis as of end December, data showed.Investment proposals in the first nine months of the financial year rose to Rs 26.62 lakh crore as of end December 2025, from Rs 23.62 lakh crore in the same period a year earlier, data released by the Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy showed, supporting the pickup in credit growth.Outstanding bank credit crossed Rs 200 lakh crore for the first time, reaching Rs 203.2 lakh crore as of December 31, 2025, RBI data shows. Year to date (YTD) credit expanded by Rs 20.78 lakh crore, compared with an increase of Rs 13.18 lakh crore in the same period a year ago.YTD credit growth at 11.4%, compared with 8% a year ago despite lingering uncertainty over trade deals points to a rebound driven by rate cuts. The pace of credit expansion has already exceeded the 11% growth projected for FY26 by the Reserve Bank of India and professional forecasters in the Monetary Policy Report released last October.Live EventsThis month’s credit and deposit data was released after recent amendments to Banking Regulations Act, 1949 that allow the RBI to publish credit and deposit numbers on the 15th and the last day of the month, instead of alternate Fridays—a move aimed at reducing interpretational ambiguity.Outstanding aggregate deposits stood at Rs 248.5 lakh crore, up 12.7% on a (y-o-y) basis and 10.1% on a YTD basis. In the corresponding period a year ago, deposits rose 9.8% y o y and 7.8% on a year to date basis.“Credit growth is being driven largely by auto loans, which typically pick up at the end of the calendar year, along with demand from small and mid sized companies, finance companies and the home loan segment,” said Saurabh Bhalerao, Associate Director and Head of BFSI Research atCare Ratings. “That said, a base effect has also come into play.

"Crude oil takes centre stage amid geopolitical storms, can it still offer investment opportunities?","As geopolitical tensions deepen, with flashpoints emerging across Venezuela, Iran, and Ukraine, crude oil has once again taken centre stage in global markets. The environment has become increasingly unpredictable, shaped by political instability, sanctions, and disruptions to global supply chains.Against this backdrop, oil prices have remained volatile, driven more by risk premiums than by traditional demand-supply fundamentals.According to Ross Maxwell, Global Strategy Operations Lead at VT Markets, crude oil is expected to remain range-bound, with sharp volatility spikes triggered by headlines. Slowing global growth may cap the upside, while geopolitical turmoil provides a floor, making oil a tactical, not linear, investment opportunity.He notes that oil may not deliver consistent returns, but can offer resilience and diversification during periods of stress.Manoj Kumar Jain of Prithvifinmart Commodity Research echoes this outlook, stating that recent geopolitical developments, such as the capture of the Venezuelan President, new trade sanctions against Iran, and ongoing tensions between Russia and Ukraine, have keptcrude oil pricesvolatile, though they may trade with a “positive bias”.Live EventsJain expects WTI crude to test levels between $68 and $74 per barrel, with $54 acting as a strong support on the lower end. In the domestic market, he seesMCX crudeconsolidating in the range of Rs 5,000 to Rs 5,400, with Rs 4,980 serving as a critical support zone.Data from 2025 reveals that crude oil closed the year with a sharp decline of over 15% in Indian markets, one of the worst performances among non-agricultural commodities. Despite this, Jain remains optimistic about a technical base forming in the first half of 2026, supported by the potential revival of global demand, easing trade tariffs, and accommodative US monetary policy.What should investors do now?In light of these dynamics, Ross Maxwell recommends that investors avoid direct exposure to crude as a commo",2026-01-22,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/crude-oil-takes-centre-stage-amid-geopolitical-storms-can-it-still-offer-investment-opportunities/articleshow/126537656.cms,neutral,economictimes,,,,1

IndusInd Bank shares in focus after Q3 update reveals 13% YoY drop in advances,"Shares ofIndusInd Bankwill be in focus on Tuesday, January 6, following the bank’s Q3 FY26 operational update, which revealed a 13% year-on-year contraction in its loan book for the December 2025 quarter.Theprivate sector lenderreported a mixed operating performance for the period, with a drop innet advancesand a sequential improvement indeposits, even as pressure on low-cost funding continued to weigh.As of December 2025, the bank’s net advances stood at Rs 3.18 lakh crore, down from the previous year and also lower by 2.2% sequentially from the September 2025 quarter.Sensex, Nifty today: Catch all the LIVE stock market action hereOn the liabilities front, total deposits were at Rs 3.94 lakh crore, a near 4% decline from Rs 4.09 lakh crore a year ago. However, deposits did show a modest 1% quarter-on-quarter rise from Rs 3.89 lakh crore, indicating some recovery in deposit mobilisation after a volatile first half of the financial year.Live EventsDespite the improvement in deposits, the share of low-cost CASA (Current Account and Savings Account) deposits continued to slide. The CASA ratio declined further to 30.3% in the December quarter, compared to 34.9% a year ago and 30.7% in the preceding quarter.The sustained fall reflects a continued shift by depositors towards higher-yielding term deposits and other investment instruments.A lower CASA ratio can lead to increased funding costs, which could in turn pressure net interest margins unless the bank is able to reprice its assets effectively. The bank’s update suggested that while advance growth remained subdued, the gradual improvement in deposit traction points to a focus onbalance sheet stability.On Monday, the shares of IndusInd Bank closed flat at Rs 899.50 on the BSE.Also read:'Too cheap to ignore': Jefferies initiates coverage on Emmvee Photovoltaic, sees 70% upside(Disclaimer: Recommendations, suggestions, views and opinions given by the experts are their own.

"Sensex falls over 300 pts, Nifty below 25,500 amid trade worries and foreign selling","Indian stocks traded lower on Tuesday, with the Sensex andNiftyextending losses into a second session as investors weighed persistent global trade uncertainties and continued foreign fund outflows, even as attention remained fixed on the unfolding quarterly earnings season.The BSE Sensex slipped over 300 points, to the day's low of 82,950, while the NSE Nifty 50 fell over 90 points, slipping below 25,500 level.On the 30-stock Sensex, losses were led byBajaj Finance,InterGlobe Aviation(IndiGo),Asian Paints,EternalandBajaj Finserv, with the stocks declining between 1% and 2% in early trade.The broader market also weakened, with mid-cap and small-cap indices slipping 0.3% and 0.4%, respectively, underscoring a cautious risk tone.Among individual stocks,Aditya Birla Fashion& Retail surged as much as 9%, outperforming the broader market.Live EventsShares ofTata Capitalclimbed more than 2% after the lender reported a strong December-quarter showing, driven by a sharp increase in profit and steady growth across key operating metrics.Expert ViewsThe volatility in the market is likely to continue in the near-term till some clarity emerges regarding the U.S.-Europe standoff on Greenland tariffs and since both sides have hardened their positions, the uncertainty will continue for some time, said Dr. VK Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist at Geojit Investments, adding that ""a new development is likely today if the U.S. Supreme Court ruling on Trump tariffs goes against President Trump. But there is no certainty on whether the ruling will happen today. If it does, the ruling might change the scenario completely overnight.""From the fundamental perspective, there are good news as well as not so good news for the market, Vijayakumar said, adding that the good news is that the IMF has raised India’s FY 26 GDP growth rate to 7.3% confirming the robust performance of the economy despite many headwinds.""An area of concern is that early Q3 results do not indicate a recovery in earn",2026-01-22,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/sensex-falls-over-300-pts-nifty-below-25500-amid-trade-worries-and-foreign-selling/articleshow/126752320.cms,neutral,economictimes,,,,1

"Rs 14 lakh crore gone in 3 days! Sensex sheds 1,660 points, Nifty falls 2%. Here are 5 key factors behind the stock market fall","Indian equities closed lower for a third consecutive session on Wednesday, deepening a sharp market rout that has erased nearly Rs 14 lakh crore in investor wealth. The selloff, driven by global jitters and uneven corporate earnings, pushed the benchmark Sensex down more than 1,660 points over three sessions, while theNifty50 slipped about 2%.The Sensex slid as much as 1,056 points intraday to a low of 81,124.45 on Wednesday, and the Nifty fell 1.2% to touch 24,919.80, as risk appetite weakened and selling pressure intensified across sectors. At its worst, the market had wiped out close to ₹6 lakh crore in a single session.Stocks later pared losses, staging a sharp rebound around midday as bargain hunters stepped into battered heavyweight names. Market participants, however, cautioned that the recovery appeared tactical rather than a sign of a durable turnaround.By the close, the BSE Sensex had trimmed losses to end down 271 points, or 0.33%, at 81,909.63. The Nifty 50 fell 75 points, or 0.30%, to settle at 25,157.50.The three-day decline has shaved about Rs 13.68 lakh crore off total market capitalisation, pulling the value of all BSE-listed companies down to Rs 454.15 lakh crore.Live EventsDharmesh Shah of ICICI Securities noted that buying interest emerged from oversold levels, with supportive demand seen below the 200-day EMA coinciding with the lower band of the rising channel drawn from the August–September 2025 lows.""Going ahead, sustaining above today’s low will be crucial to maintain the recovery bias, while a decisive move above the previous session’s high would signal follow-through strength and open the path for technical pullback towards the 25,600 zone,"" said Shah.Market breadth is always a good indicator to understand the sentiment of the market, Shah said, adding that ""Historically it has been observed that whenever the net of advance-decline of total CNX500 has approached the level of 440-470, it is a sign of capitulation and market has a tendency t",2026-01-22,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/why-is-stock-market-falling-today-rs-3-lakh-crore-gone-sensex-cracks-over-700-points-nifty-below-25100-5-key-factors-behind-the-stock-market-fall-today/articleshow/126933526.cms,neutral,economictimes,,,,1

"Premium gain, margin strain likely for insurers in December quarter","Mumbai: Theinsurance sectoris likely to report a steady performance for the third quarter of this financial year, aided by strongpremium growthacross life, general and health insurers after goods and services tax (GST) relaxations, even as margins remain under pressure, according to analysts.Most large life insurers, including state-ownedLife InsuranceCorporation (LIC) and private insurers such asHDFC Life, Axis Max andSBI Life, are expected to report double-digit growth in annualised premium equivalent (APE) for October-December 2025, aided by GST-related tailwinds and an easier base following the implementation of revised surrender value norms.Lower effective prices, particularly for term protection products, have supported demand, helping private insurers sustain momentum. LIC is expected to benefit from a low base and see growth of more than 40% in APE, especially due to an increase in group business.Profitability, however, remains a challenge. Value of new business (VNB) margins are expected to stay under pressure due to the loss of GST input tax credits, alongside higher employee-related costs following labour code implementation. Insurers are attempting to cushion the impact through a gradual shift toward higher-margin non-participating and protection products, as well as tighter distributor negotiations. These measures are expected to partially offset margin compression during the quarter.General insurers are likely to post double-digit growth in gross written premiums, mainly driven by continued strength in motor and health insurance. The reduction in GST rates has supported new vehicle sales, lifting demand in the motor segment, while retailhealth insurancehas benefited from improved affordability following GST exemptions.Live EventsFrom September 22 last year, the government did away with the 18% GST levied earlier on individual term insurance and health insurance premiums.Despite strong revenue growth, combined ratios for general insurers are expected to",2026-01-22,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/premium-gain-margin-strain-likely-for-insurers-in-december-quarter/articleshow/126425080.cms,neutral,economictimes,,,,1

Australian shares rebound from 3-week low on mining boost; banks drag,"Australian shares rebounded on Wednesday from a three-week low hit in the previous session, lifted by iron ore and gold miners, though gains were ‌capped by financial stocks ‌as a sticky core inflation reading kept the possibility of a rate hike alive.The S&P/ASX 200 edged ‌0.2% higher to finish at 8,695.60. The benchmark slipped 0.5% on Tuesday to mark its weakest session in three weeks.Local data showed earlier in the day that consumer prices rose by less than forecast in November.

"What ITR forms reveal about investing choices of Gen Z, millennials","India’sincome tax filingsare beginning to tell a story that goes well beyond salaries. New data from tax filings show that ITR-3 filings, which cater to taxpayers with business or trading income, have jumped 45.4% year-on-year, while ITR-2 filings, used by individuals reporting capital gains and investment income, rose 17%.The report added that a notable (8 in 10 or 83.38%) of all ITR-3 filings also reported Capital Gains income, reflecting that traditional salary-onlytax returnis steadily giving way to filings that combine wages with business income, capital gains, derivatives trading and even digital assets.Millennialsaged 25–35 are at the centre of this transition. Forming the backbone of the economy, data shows they now account for 42.3% of all ITR-3 filings. They also make up the largest share of both new and returning trading taxpayers, pointing to a generation that is actively combining jobs with market income and business activity.Millennials dominate both new & returning trader filers, confirming this is a long-term, sticky behavior. They are the most active cohort when it comes to managing risk and finances, Archit Gupta, Founder and CEO ofClearTaxsaid.Gen Ztaxpayers are also showing early signs of similar behaviour. Among filers under the age of 25, ITR-2 filings grew 18% year-on-year, indicating that first-time tax returns are increasingly capturing investment income alongside salaries, stipends or internships. “This shows a real shift in how young Indians build wealth. Earlier generations spent their 20s saving slowly and playing it safe. This generation is starting earlier, entering the workforce already investing and trading.

‘Pray that stocks don’t fall’: Nithin Kamath warns Rs 1.1 lakh crore margin trading boom has worrying risks,"Zerodhafounder and CEONithin Kamathhas flagged what he calls a “structural risk” building up in India’sequitymarkets, warning that the rapid growth of themargin tradingfacility (MTF) could amplify market stress during the next sharp correction.In a detailed post on X, Kamath said MTF, a mechanism that allows investors to buy shares by borrowing from their broker against a margin, has expanded nearly five-fold over the last four years to more than Rs 1.10 lakh crore.He noted that this growth has accelerated particularly after higher margins andsecurities transaction tax(STT) were imposed on derivatives trading, pushing leveraged activity into the cash market instead.MTF, or margin trading facility, allows investors to purchase shares by paying only a portion of the total value upfront, typically 20 to 25%, with the broker funding the rest. Regulations permit leverage of up to five times on approved stocks.Unlike derivatives, where positions are marked to market daily and typically short-term, MTF positions can be held for months, making risk accumulation slower but potentially more severe.Live EventsKamath’s concern is not the existence of MTF itself, but the absence of a robust, system-wide risk model governing how it is offered and managed. According to him, competition among brokers has led to a “race to the bottom”, where almost every firm offers the maximum leverage allowed by regulation. Any broker that takes a more conservative stance risks losing market share. This, he argued, leaves little room for differentiated risk management.He highlighted that MTF carries multiple risk multipliers compared with futures and options. Clients tend to hold positions for much longer periods, leverage is available across nearly 1,300 stocks including many illiquid names, and positions are overwhelmingly on the buy side. This makes it far harder to manage downside risk, especially during periods of stress.Kamath also pointed to what he described as “insane” leverage when stock",2026-01-22,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/pray-that-stocks-dont-fall-nithin-kamath-warns-rs-1-1-lakh-crore-margin-trading-boom-has-worrying-risks/articleshow/126967922.cms,neutral,economictimes,,,,1

"Reliance Industries shares rebound 2.2% from day's low, still down 5% in 2026. Should you buy before Q3 results on Friday?","Shares of Mukesh Ambani-ledReliance Industriesrebounded 2.2% from the day’s low to end 0.5% higher at Rs 1,483 on January 12, snapping their recent slide. Despite the recovery, the stock remains under pressure in 2026 so far, having declined over 5% year-to-date. The oil-to-telecom conglomerate is scheduled to announce its December-quarter (Q3FY26) results on January 16.Should you buy, sell or hold ahead of earnings?On January 9, Goldman Sachs raised its 12-month price target onReliance Industriesto Rs 1,835 a share, implying an upside of about 25% from current levels. The brokerage has reiterated its Buy rating, arguing that near-term moderation in retail will be offset by improving refining fundamentals and steady momentum in telecom, keeping Reliance’s medium-term earnings trajectory intact.The brokerage expects Q3 earnings growth in retail to moderate due to weak discretionary spending, base effects and festive timing. However, this is likely to be partly offset by a strong refining-led performance in the oil-to-chemicals (O2C) business. As a result, overall earnings remain largely unchanged despite tweaks at the segment level.Nomura estimated Reliance Industries’ consolidatedEBITDAat Rs 47,600 crore for 3QFY26F, reflecting a 4% quarter-on-quarter increase. While the refining segment is expected to deliver a strong performance, this could be partly offset by weaker petrochemical margins and a muted showing in the retail business. Meanwhile, Jio is likely to report steady operating performance during the quarter. Analysts have a Buy call and a target price of Rs 1,700 per share.Within the Oil-to-Chemicals (O2C) segment, EBITDA is estimated at Rs 16,500 crore, up 10% QoQ, led by widening refining margins. The improvement is expected to be driven by sequential gains in gasoline, diesel and jet fuel spreads, although softer petrochemical margins may partially temper the overall upside.Live EventsFor the Upstream business, Nomura forecasts EBITDA of Rs 4,900 crore, d",2026-01-22,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/ril-shares-tumble-8-in-2026-should-you-buy-before-q3-results-on-friday/articleshow/126478400.cms,neutral,economictimes,,,,1

RBI plans new eligibility norms for urban co-op bank licences,"Mumbai: An internal working group of the central bank has suggested new eligibility parameters for grantingurban cooperative banking(UCB) licences. Credit cooperative societies with a minimum capital of ₹300 crore,capital adequacy ratioabove 12%, netnon-performing loansbelow 3% and sound track records for five years would qualify.The proposal, outlined in a Reserve Bank of India (RBI) discussion paper published on Monday, marks the first step toward reopening UCB licensing after a pause of more than two decades.The RBI said the move aims to strengthen governance and financial resilience in the sector, which has historically faced challenges such as weak capital structures, governance lapses, and technology gaps.The paper argues that only large, well-managedcooperative credit societiesbe considered for conversion into UCBs. These entities must demonstrate at least 10 years of active operations and a progressive financial performance over the immediately preceding five years.The RBI also emphasised that governance standards for UCBs mirror those for commercial banks, requiring professional and independent boards.Live EventsStatutory amendments to State and Multi-State Cooperative Acts may be necessary to enforce these norms. As on March 31, 2025, the number of UCBs totalled 1,457.At present, there are 82 weak UCBs under supervisory restrictions; while 28 very weak UCBs have been placed under the All-Inclusive Directions, 32 UCBs are under Prompt Corrective Action and 22 UCBs are under Supervisory Action Framework.Addas a Reliable and Trusted News SourceAdd Now!(You can now subscribe to ourETMarkets WhatsApp channel) (You can now subscribe to ourETMarkets WhatsApp channel)",2026-01-22,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/rbi-plans-new-eligibility-norms-for-urban-co-op-bank-licences/articleshow/126515373.cms,neutral,economictimes,,,,1

Time to buy the fear?","Shares of leadingelectronics manufacturing services(EMS) players such asDixon Technologies,KaynesTechnologyand PG Electroplasthave corrected sharply, falling as much as 53% from their respective peaks, triggering a reset in investor sentiment around one of India’s most crowded structural growth themes. Once market darlings riding the China-plus-one and PLI narratives, these stocks are now grappling with a cocktail of earnings uncertainty, policy risks and valuation fatigue.Kaynes shares have tumbled 53% from 52-week high, whilePG ElectroplastandDixonare down 42%. Epack Durable has shed 50%, Amber 29%, and Syrma SGS 22%. What was a broad-based rally has turned into a savage correction, forcing a hard reset across the electronics manufacturing services (EMS) space.Multiple catalysts have converged to trigger the rout. A massive surge in memory chip (DRAM) prices is hammeringsmartphone demandand squeezing margins forDixon Technologies, India's largest Android handset maker, which produces devices for Xiaomi, Motorola, Vivo, Oppo, Transsion and Realme. Regulatory overhang around pending government approvals for joint ventures threatens volumes and profitability from FY27 onwards. Softer seasonal demand in consumer durables has added pressure, while the looming March deadline for the mobile PLI scheme, set to expire this month, casts a shadow over future growth visibility.Company-specific troubles have deepened the pain. Kaynes has faced scrutiny over disclosure lapses and stretched working capital, with receivables ballooning in recent quarters.PG Electroplastsuffered a weaker-than-expected summer season. For Dixon, market trackers point to three key risks: potential volume and margin hits from FY27 due to pending joint venture approvals, the memory price surge denting smartphone demand, and expectations of weak December quarter growth.Yet even after the steep drawdown, the question of whether these stocks now represent value remains fiercely contested.Live EventsJP Mor",2026-01-22,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/dixon-kaynes-pg-electroplast-shares-crash-up-to-53-time-to-buy-the-fear/articleshow/126667426.cms,neutral,economictimes,,,,1

"Asian shares post modest early gains, Yen weakens","Asian sharesposted a modest gain at the open, while Japanese equities extended their record-breaking run fueled by aweaker yen.TheNikkei 225Stock Average advanced 0.9%, with the Japanese currency slipping past the 159-per-dollar level to the weakest since July 2024. Stocks in the country have jumped and the currency fallen amid reports of a snap election. Shares in South Korea edged up, having posted a gain on every trading day of 2026.In Tuesday’s US session, the S&P 500 fell from an all-time high, asJPMorgan Chase& Co. led a slide in lenders after its investment-banking fees missed guidance. US benchmarks dropped after December inflation data did little to dent expectations that theFederal Reservewill pause interest-rate cuts.Traders are going into Wednesday awaiting a possible US Supreme Court ruling on President Donald Trump’s global tariffs that were announced in April.Meanwhile, the cooler-than-expected US consumer price index reading reinforced bond traders’ expectations that the Fed will wait until mid-year to cut rates. Even after Fed Chair Jerome Powell and his board lowered the benchmark three times last year, money markets have continued to project the next reduction only in mid-2026.Live Events“The initial excitement sparked by a cooler-than-anticipated core CPI was short-lived,” said Jose Torres at Interactive Brokers. “The reversal was influenced, in part, by the report’s failure to pull forward the next expected rate reduction from June to April, as fixed-income watchers project Powell’s December cut will be his last at the helm.”Following JPMorgan’s results Tuesday, earnings from megabank rivals Bank of America Corp., Wells Fargo & Co., Citigroup Inc., Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Morgan Stanley are slated for Wednesday and Thursday. The group is expected to post its second-highest annual profit ever, boosted by Trump’s policy changes.Traders also are mindful of the potential for a US Supreme Court ruling Wednesday on tariffs the White House has bee",2026-01-22,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/asian-shares-post-modest-early-gains-yen-weakens/articleshow/126515545.cms,neutral,economictimes,,,,1

Banks feel the pinch as CASA pool shrinks,"Lenders are witnessing a steady decline in their CASA (current account-savings account) ratio, reflecting intense competition for deposits and a structural shift in household savings toward higher-yieldingmarket-linked instruments, an analysis of latest earnings and executive commentaries showed.HDFC Bank's CASA ratio fell 43 basis points (bps) year-on-year (YoY) and 27 bps quarter-on-quarter (QoQ), whileICICI Bankreported a 27 bps decline YoY and a sharper 63 bps sequential fall.One basis point is a hundredth of a percentage point.""On the institutional side, CASA has proved a bit of a dampener on the overall numbers,"" said Anindya Banerjee, Group Chief Financial Officer, ICICI Bank, during the post-earnings analyst call. ""That's not a very large proportion of our deposit base, and hopefully this impact will moderate going forward, but it has been an issue over the last couple of quarters.""Live EventsOther banks have seen a similar trend, underscoring the sector-wide nature of the pressure.CASA deposits are considered the cheapest source of funding for banks as current accounts carry no interest and savings accounts offer relatively low rates, helping lenders keep their cost of funds low and support margins while expanding credit.Banks are increasingly finding it difficult to mobilise low-cost deposits as savers gravitate towards equities, mutual funds and other investment products offering better returns in a high-rateenvironment.Credit-Deposit RatioAs of December 31, 2025, deposits grew 12.7% year-on-year, while loans expanded faster at 14.5%, according to central bank data. At the same time, competition for bulk and institutional deposits has intensified, adding to volatility in pricing.""Funding through deposits has been underpinned by rate discipline,"" said Srinivasan Vaidyanathan, CFO of HDFC Bank, during the post-earnings media call. ""Non-retail deposits have seen enormous volatility in pricing and high competition from some institutions, which we try to avoid",2026-01-22,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/banks-feel-the-pinch-as-casa-pool-shrinks/articleshow/126737250.cms,neutral,economictimes,,,,1

China’s $1.2 trillion windfall quietly seeps into global markets,"A record trade surplus racked up byChinais washing up around the world, as export earnings that once ended up in state coffers instead fund massive private purchases of overseas securities and business expansion abroad.Rather than leaving most of last year’s $1.2 trillion windfall in the hands of the central bank, some two-thirds of the foreign assets sourced primarily from global trade ended up with companies, individuals and state lenders. That brings with it the risk of a sudden capital reversal that China doesn’t immediately control, especially in a world where the yuan is allowed to strengthen.Investors comprising China’s so-called non-official sector saw their holdings of assets abroad soar by more than $1 trillion in the first three quarters of last year — according to the latest available data from China’s currency market regulator — more than double the annual average growth in the past decade.BloombergPutting that money to work last year resulted in a $535 billion surge in Chinese private purchases of overseas securities like US stocks, European bonds and mutual funds, Bloomberg calculations show, though a more detailed geographical breakdown of the investments isn’t available. The increase through September outpaced any full-year increase over the past two decades and was far more than poured out of China in the form of direct investments used to build factories and warehouses or expand staffing abroad.Live EventsThe quiet migration of capital into global markets is ushering in a new era that does away with a centralized system of managing the wealth reeled in from China’s outsized role in manufacturing and commerce. For a world already uneasy over the huge imbalances in trade, another outcome is a global financial system increasingly reliant on liquidity sourced from China.“As China’s private investment footprint grows, it will inevitably play a larger role in global capital flows,” said Peiqian Liu, an Asia economist at Fidelity International, which man",2026-01-22,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/chinas-1-2-trillion-windfall-quietly-seeps-into-global-markets/articleshow/126555689.cms,neutral,economictimes,,,,1

Sebi approves separate auction session to determine closing stock prices,"Capital markets regulatorSebihas decided to change the wayclosing prices of sharesare calculated in the equity cash market. Instead of using the average price of trades in the last 30 minutes of trading, exchanges will move to a new system called theClosing Auction Session(CAS).At present, the closing price of a stock is based on the volume-weighted average price of trades between 3:00 pm and 3:30 pm. Sebi said this method can sometimes distort prices, especially for large orders placed nearmarket close. Globally, most major markets already use an auction-based system to decide closing prices.Under the new framework, CAS will run for 20 minutes from 3:15 pm to 3:35 pm on all trading days. The session will have separate phases for calculating a reference price, order entry, and order matching. Orders will close randomly in the last two minutes to prevent manipulation.Initially, CAS will apply only to stocks that havederivatives contracts. For other shares, the existing VWAP-based method will continue for now. The reference price for the auction will be calculated using the VWAP of trades between 3:00 pm and 3:15 pm. If there are no trades in that window, the last traded price of the day will be used.During CAS, both market and limit orders will be allowed, but stop-loss and iceberg orders will not be permitted. The closing price will be discovered through an equilibrium price mechanism, which selects the price at which the maximum volume can be matched. If multiple prices qualify, Sebi has laid out clear rules to pick the final closing price.Live EventsSebi said the change will make closing prices more transparent and reliable. This is important because closing prices are used for derivative settlement, index calculation, and mutual fund NAVs. The regulator also noted that CAS will help passive funds and large investors execute trades at fair prices with lower impact costs.Along with CAS, Sebi has also aligned the pre-open auction session with the new framework.

Mahindra’s SUV blitz draws Nomura’s top-pick call while Bajaj’s EV gamble leaves limited upside,"Mahindra & Mahindra’s latest SUV launches have kicked off 2026 with a surge of bookings that has Nomura doubling down on the stock as its top automobile pick, even as the brokerage struck a more cautious tone onBajaj Autodespite a cheaper electric scooter aimed at mass buyers. The divergent calls reflect where Nomura sees the clearest money to be made in India’s auto space, backing Mahindra for growth while favouringAther EnergyandTVS Motorover Bajaj in two-wheelers.Mahindra & Mahindra, Nomura said in a note dated January 14, has seen a “strong customer response across both the ICE and EV portfolios” after the launch of the refreshed XUV 7XO and the all-electric XEV 9S, with the two models together clocking 93,689 bookings by 2 pm on January 14, the very first day bookings opened.Mahindra’s SUV push gathers speed“XUV 7X0 and XEV 9S are off to a strong start,” Nomura wrote, adding that the launches “meaningfully strengthen MM’s positioning in the premium SUV space, with competitive pricing and a materially improved feature set supporting demand visibility.”Mahindra launched the updated XUV 7XO on January 5 at an introductory price of Rs 13.66 lakh for the first 40,000 units, while the seven-seater electric XEV 9S was introduced on November 27 at an introductory price of Rs 19.95 lakh. Nomura currently builds in volumes of about 7,500 to 7,800 units a month for the XUV 7XO in FY26 and FY27, and around 3,000 to 4,000 units a month for the XEV 9S over the medium term.Live EventsThe brokerage estimates that electric vehicles account for about 15% of the combined order book of the two models, warning that the “strong initial booking momentum for both models presents an upside risk to our volume assumptions.”Nomura expects Mahindra’s SUV volumes to outpace industry growth, forecasting growth of about 18%, 11% and 7% over FY26, FY27 and FY28, translating into monthly sales of 54,000, 60,000 and 65,000 units respectively. That outlook includes battery electric vehicle sales",2026-01-22,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/mahindras-suv-blitz-draws-nomuras-top-pick-call-while-bajajs-ev-gamble-leaves-limited-upside/articleshow/126540129.cms,neutral,economictimes,,,,1

Hindustan Zinc shares tumble 10% in two days! Should investors buy this dip?,"Hindustan Zinc sharesfell as much as 6.5% to their day’s low of Rs 588 on Thursday, January 8, aftersilver pricesextended their decline during the session, weighing on sentiment around the country’s largest producer of the precious metal. With today’s fall, the stock is down for a second session in a row, slipping 10% over the same period.The decline followed a sharp correction in silver prices, which fell by as much as Rs 7,000 per kilogram, or 2.75%, to Rs 2,43,704 on the Multi Commodity Exchange of India. Silver exchange-traded funds also edged lower, reflecting weakness in the underlying metal.The sharp correction in Hindustan Zinc is seen as a result of profit booking after a strong rally in 2025, when the stock surged nearly 40%. Looking ahead, all eyes are on US jobs data due later this week.Hindustan Zinc, which produces refined silver with a minimum purity of 99.9%, has seen its shares rally strongly over the past year. The stock climbed from around Rs 400 to above Rs 600, raising concerns among some market participants about the scope for further near-term gains.“Hindustan Zinc could continue to do well as long as silver prices remain high because profitability increases significantly. But the stock has already run up sharply, leaving limited upside for fresh investors,” said Sameer Dalal, CEO of Natverlal & Sons Stockbrokers.Live EventsLong-term story intact?In December, Jefferies, while initiating coverage on Hindustan Zinc, said it views the company as a clear beneficiary of elevated silver and zinc prices, supported by its first-decile zinc mining costs. While volume growth is expected to remain modest, earnings momentum is projected to stay strong. EPS is estimated to grow 22% in FY26 and 29% in FY27, followed by another 7% rise in FY28.The brokerage expects robust cash generation and healthy return ratios, with FY26-28 EPS estimates placed well above broader Street expectations. The brokerage has a target price of Rs 660, an upside potential of 5%.Wh",2026-01-22,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/hindustan-zinc-shares-tumble-10-in-two-days-should-investors-buy-this-dip/articleshow/126410474.cms,neutral,economictimes,,,,1

"US, Europe dominate FPI flows, Singapore & Mauritius lose out","Mumbai: Overseas capital in Indian equities has undergone a structural shift in the past decade, with foreign portfolio investors domiciled in the US and Europe steadily displacing vehicles from traditional tax-friendly jurisdictions. Data from ICICI Securities showed US-based FPIs accounted for 44% ofFPI equity assetsin India as of December, as against 34% a decade ago. European centres, such as Ireland and Norway, have also seen a consistent increase in their share of India-focused assets. The share of foreign equity assets from Mauritius, which was a dominant route through which foreign capital flowed into India, has declined to 4.1% in 2025 from 21% in 2015.The shift has been driven by tighter tax norms and stricter regulatory disclosures, which have reduced the advantage of routing flows through tax-friendly jurisdictions such as Mauritius and Singapore.Global funds routed money through Mauritius because these countries had tax treaties giving these countries exclusive right to capital gains taxation. ""This changed in 2017 when India amended the tax treaty where it now has the right to tax sale of Indian shares by entities of Mauritius and Singapore,"" said Amit Maheshwari, tax partner, AKM Global. ""Mauritius remains favorable as dividends are to be taxed at 5% (threshold 10% or more ownership) and interest at 7.5%, however, one has to adhere to the principal purpose test introduced in the tax treaties (in India Mauritius DTAA, not ratified).""AgenciesNO TAX EDGE FOR TRADITIONAL ROUTES: Shift driven by tighter tax norms, stricter disclosures; US-based entities have 44% share of FPI equity assets as of Dec against 34% a decade agoThis means that if the principal purpose of the investment was to take a tax benefit then India can disregard the treaty from its application which might have contributed to a dip in investments routed through Mauritius, said Maheshwari.The Sebi tightened foreign portfolio investor rules, requiring full disclosure of beneficial ownership",2026-01-22,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/us-europe-dominate-fpi-flows-singapore-mauritius-lose-out/articleshow/126536302.cms,neutral,economictimes,,,,1

"Sensex drops over 200 pts, Nifty below 26,150 amid tariff jitters and foreign selling","Indian equities opened lower on Thursday, with the Sensex andNiftyextending a cautious run into a fourth straight session as concerns over U.S. tariffs and continued foreign fund outflows overshadowed pockets of optimism around earnings growth.TheBSESensex fell 220 points, or 0.27%, to 84,735, while theNSENifty 50 slipped 69 points, or 0.26%, to 26,071, keeping benchmarks under pressure in early trade.On the 30-stock Sensex,TCS,Asian Paints,Reliance Industries,UltraTech CementandMaruti Suzukiwere among the biggest drags, with losses ranging from about 1% to 1.5%.Broader markets were little changed, with mid-cap and small-cap indexes trading largely flat.HDFC Bankand Reliance Industries, the heaviest weights on the benchmark indices, which have been under pressure this whole week, slipped between 0.5% to 1% in early trade.Live EventsExpert viewsFrom the fundamental perspective, there is good news for the economy and markets, said Dr. VK Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist at Geojit Investments, adding that advanced estimates project the FY26 GDP growth at an impressive 7.4%.""This reflects the underlying resilience of the economy despite Trump tariffs. However, this strong fundamental is unlikely to reflect in the market very soon since the much-awaited US-India trade deal, which is critical for India’s sustained growth and macro-economic stability, is not happening. This and the continuing FII selling are impacting the market. Even though Indian large cap valuations are fair, cheaper valuations in other markets do not offer compelling need for FIIs to buy in India,"" said Vijayakumar.The market mood may change if the Supreme Court verdict on the reciprocal tariffs, expected soon, goes against President Trump, said Vijayakumar.FII/DII TrackerOn the institutional front, Foreign Institutional Investors (FIIs) sold equities worth nearly Rs 1,528 crore on January 7, while Domestic Institutional Investors (DIIs) were net buyers to the tune of Rs 2,889 crore.Global Mark",2026-01-22,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/sensex-drops-over-200-pts-nifty-below-26150-amid-tariff-jitters-and-foreign-selling/articleshow/126406230.cms,neutral,economictimes,,,,1

Trent sees sharpest fall in six months after Q3 update spooks Street,"Mumbai: Shares ofTrent, Tata Group's retail chain, plunged over 8% on Tuesday-the steepest single-day decline in six months-after the company's third quarter business update disappointed investors. Analysts said investors could cut exposure to the stock as the current earnings growth does not justify the rich valuations.The stock slumped 8.5% to close at ₹4,055 on Tuesday, eroding the company's market cap by over ₹13,500 crore. ""The Street was anticipating a high double-digit revenue growth rate, which Trent failed to deliver, and the steep valuations are also a concern,"" said Vyom Chheda, research analyst, StoxBox. ""Currently, the stock is trading at around 90 times price to earnings.""Trent, a market darling during the bull run until September 2024, skyrocketed nearly 1,700% in less than five years from its March 2020 lows. Since October 2024, the stock has been on a downward slide, shedding 40% in 2025 as against the near 11% upmove in the Nifty. Analysts said slowing growth expectations are weighing on the stock. Chheda said that the company is growing at 17% year on year, which is quite low because of economic slowdown and densification.At the same time, its valuations remain rich. Trent continues to trade at a rich multiple of about 70-75 times price to earnings, said Dharmesh Kant, head of research,CholamandalamSecurities.""The best is behind Trent as the best probable growth rate is expected to hit a ceiling of 25% and the stock is likely to witness time-wise corrections,"" said Kant. ""Investors can book profits as Trent is not expected to offer any meaningful money-making opportunities in the next two years.""Live EventsChheda also recommends selling unless earnings flash a revival in growth.AgenciesStock likely to correct as growth rate is expected to top out at 25%, investors can cut exposure: AnalystsThe weakness in Trent's shares rubbed off on other retail chains on Tuesday.

"Buy or sell? What TCS, HCL Tech results mean for IT stocks after Rs 75,000 crore FII selloff","WhileTCSandHCL Techshares were trading little changed on Tuesday post theirQ3 resultsannounced on Monday, brokerages and market strategists are increasingly debating whether the combination of earnings trends, valuation support, and demand signals warrants a tactical buy or continued caution amid a deep Rs 75,000-croreFII selloffin 2025 that has left the sector among the year’s worst-hit.Brokerages tracking the Q3 numbers suggest the sector’s outlook hinges on a delicate balance between structural demand shifts and near-term execution.Jefferiesnoted that TCS’s quarter delivered largely in-line revenue with muted margin performance and limited evidence of a meaningful pick-up in international growth. Productivity gains embedded in contract renewals, while helpful for efficiency, are expected to temper topline momentum as clients push for 10–15% efficiency improvements, leading the firm to maintain a Hold rating with a revised target of Rs 3,485.By contrast, analysts at Jefferies andEmkayseeHCL Technologies’ results as relatively more resilient. Emkay highlighted that HCL Tech posted better-than-expected revenue and margin outcomes, supported by strong net new deal wins and expanding AI-linked revenues. Jefferies expects HCL Tech to deliver the highest recurring EPS compound annual growth among India’s top five IT firms over FY26–28, underpinning a Buy view with a rolled-over target price.This nuanced backdrop of modest growth, pricing pressure, persistent geopolitical and discretionary spend headwinds, but pockets of structural AI demand has shaped market commentary around the notion of an inflection point, not as a consensus buy signal, but as a juncture where stock-specific execution and demand traction, rather than broad sector momentum, will likely drive performance.HCL Technologies delivered the quarter's standout performance, posting better-than-expected revenue and margin outcomes that have prompted bullish calls from key brokerages. Revenue grew 4.2% quarter-",2026-01-22,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/buy-or-sell-what-tcs-hcl-tech-results-mean-for-it-stocks-after-rs-75000-crore-fii-selloff/articleshow/126498262.cms,neutral,economictimes,,,,1

Retail investors trim stakes in 12 small-cap stocks for 3 straight quarters; 3 surge over 100% in FY26,"As December-quarter shareholding data for nearly 505 small-cap companies begins to roll out, early disclosures are already revealing an interesting market contradiction. A deeper analysis shows that retail investors have steadily reduced their stakes for three consecutive quarters in FY26 across 68 small-cap stocks. (Note: Retail investors are resident individuals holding nominal share capital up to Rs 2 lakhs)What makes this trend intriguing is the price action. More than half of these stocks—35 out of 68—have delivered double-digit returns in FY26 so far, even as retail participation continued to decline. Is this retail profit-booking after a strong rally, or are investors prematurely stepping aside and missing the next leg of upside? The answer, as always, lies somewhere between caution and conviction—and only time will tell. In this analysis, we spotlight 12 small-cap stocks that surged between 40% and 130% during FY26, including three multibaggers, highlighting a growing disconnect between ownership trends and market performance. (Data Source: ACE Equity) The stock has rallied 128% in FY26 so far, rising from Rs 13 to Rs 29. Meanwhile, retail shareholding has steadily declined from 21.31% in June ’25 to 18.29% in September ’25, and further to 17.03% in December ’25. In FY26 so far, the stock has surged 128%, climbing from Rs 9,046 to Rs 20,580. Retail shareholding, however, has consistently slipped from 20.09% in June ’25 to 20.04% in September ’25, and further to 19.61% in December ’25. The stock has gained 102% in FY26 so far, moving up from Rs 60 to Rs 122. During the same period, retail shareholding declined from 37.63% in June ’25 to 35.11% in September ’25, and further to 34.85% in December ’25. In FY26 so far, the stock has rallied 87%, rising from Rs 174 to Rs 325. Retail ownership has steadily fallen from 15.73% in June ’25 to 13.70% in September ’25, and further to 12.35% in December ’25. The stock has advanced 81% in FY26 so far, climbing from Rs 150",2026-01-22,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/retail-investors-trim-stakes-in-12-small-cap-stocks-for-3-straight-quarters-3-surge-over-100-in-fy26/slideshow/126606958.cms,neutral,economictimes,,,,1

"Hindustan Zinc shares jump 2% as silver hits record high, up 26% in 2026. Here’s what experts are saying","Shares ofHindustan Zincjumped 2% to an intraday high of Rs 642 on the BSE on Wednesday, January 14, after silver prices soared 3% to fresh record high of $89.60 per troy ounce. With today’s move, the white metal is up 26% in 2026, continuing its splendid run from 2025.In the domestic market, silver hit its new peak at Rs 2,83,598/kg.Hindustan Zinc ranks among the world’s top five silver producers, with an annual capacity of around 800 tonnes. Silver is a key earnings driver for the company, contributing about 38% to its EBIT.Safe-haven demand has strengthened in recent sessions amid escalating tensions between the US and Iran, along with reports that Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell was threatened with criminal indictment by the Trump administration over his Congressional testimony.What should investors do?Live Events“Hindustan Zinc has delivered a robust performance over the past month, gaining more than 10%. From a technical perspective, the stock remains in strong bullish momentum and is trading above all key moving averages and critical support levels, indicating sustained strength over the long term,” Sachin Gupta, VP-Research of Choice Equity Broking, told ETMarkets.Momentum indicators such as the RSI are in positive territory, reinforcing the presence of bullish sentiment in the near term. Considering the current market momentum, traders are advised to adopt a buy-on-dips strategy for this stock, Gupta added. Any decline towards the Rs 610–Rs 605 zone could present a good buying opportunity, with strong support placed around the Rs 578 level. On the upside, the stock has the potential to test resistance levels of Rs 650 and Rs 670 in the coming sessions.Last month, international brokerage firm Jefferies initiated coverage with a Buy call and a target price of Rs 660 per share. That’s an upside of 5% from current market levels.Hindustan Zinc stands out as a key beneficiary of rising silver and zinc prices, supported by its first-decile zinc mining costs.

"Adani Power shares may see another 23% growth, says JM Financial while initiating coverage","Domestic brokerage firmJM Financialhas initiated coverage onAdani Powerwith a ‘Buy’ rating, setting a target price of Rs 178 per share. This implies a potential upside of 22.8% from the current market price of approximately Rs 145.The brokerage’s optimism stems from the company’s strong execution capabilities, dominant position in the thermal power space, and the robust demand outlook for power in India.JM Financial highlights that Adani Power has strategically built capacities to become India’s largest private sector thermal power producer, currently operating at 18.1GW. The company is now aiming to scale up its capacity to 41.9GW by FY32, with a combination of 10.8GW organic and 7.3GW inorganic capacity in place.The brokerage notes that Adani Power has been the first to act in synchronising critical assets like the 4,620MW Mundra project within a 36-month timeline and pre-ordering key equipment to avoid delays.The report further emphasises the indispensability of thermal power in meeting India’s projected peak power demand of over 700GW by 2047.Live EventsWith the increasing penetration of variable renewable energy sources such as solar and wind, JM Financial believes grid reliability will rely on dependable base load thermal generation. India’s coal-fired generation capacity is estimated to reach 340GW by 2047, with incremental additions of 137GW required to meet this goal.In this context, Adani Power’s early positioning and aggressive capacity build-out offer a significant edge.On financial metrics, JM Financial expects EBITDA per MW to rise from Rs 13 million/MW in FY25 to Rs 18 million/MW by FY32. Net debt/EBITDA is projected to climb from 1.6x in FY25 to 3.0x by FY29, given the incremental debt for capital expenditure of Rs 2 trillion over FY25–32.However, this is expected to moderate back to 1.6x by FY31 as operational capacity comes online.The brokerage anticipates Adani Power to deliver a revenue/EBITDA CAGR of 15%/18% during FY25–28, driven by strong oper",2026-01-22,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/adani-power-shares-may-see-another-23-growth-says-jm-financial-while-initiating-coverage/articleshow/126350139.cms,neutral,economictimes,,,,1

Regulation a challenge in digital era: RBI deputy governor Shirish Chandra Murmu,"Mumbai: India's central bank warned thatrapid digitalisationis compressing the time available for regulators to respond to risks, demanding more agile oversight to safeguardfinancial stability.""Digitalisation has compressed the time dimension in finance... narrowing the time available between early warning and realised impact,"" said RBI deputy governor Shirish Chandra Murmu at the College of Supervisors' global conference. ""Regulatory processes must evolve towards proactive detection and agile interventions without sacrificing prudence and quality of judgement.""Murmu flagged five major challenges for regulators in the digital era, starting with the speed of technological change. ""New applications and business models are emerging with increasing frequency, challenging the appropriateness and speed ofregulatory response,"" he said.He also cautioned that digitalisation is blurring traditional regulatory boundaries, creating fragmented oversight. ""Many financial activities are now being unbundled and delivered through non-financial platforms... no single authority has a comprehensive, end-to-end view of the entire activity chain,"" Murmu noted.Indicating that prescriptive rules risk becoming obsolete as technologies evolve, while principle-based frameworks can lead to uneven application.

Warren Buffett's successor eyes selling off Berkshire Hathaway's 325 million Kraft Heinz shares,"Warren Buffett's successor appears to be considering his first significant move after taking over as CEO this month.Kraft Heinzwarned investors Tuesday thatBerkshire Hathawaymay be interested in selling its 325 million shares in the name brand food giant that Buffett helped create back in 2015. The news came in a filing with stock market regulators.Buffett and the Brazilian investment firm 3G Capital orchestrated the merger of Kraft and Heinz back then because they already owned Heinz and believed in the power of their brands. NowGreg Abelmay be plotting a different course.Over the years since Buffett had come to realize that the company's competitive moat around its brands wasn't as strong as he thought as consumers have increasingly been willing to switch to store brands and move away from processed foods. Berkshire took a $3.76 billion writedown on its Kraft-Heinz stake last summer. Buffett said last fall that he was disappointed in Kraft Heinz' plan to split the company in two, and Berkshire's two representatives resigned from the Kraft board last spring.But still it was rare for Buffett to unload an acquisition during his six decades leading Berkshire even when he soured on a business' prospects. Berkshire didn't respond to questions Tuesday about the filing where Kraft Heinz disclosed that its largest shareholder ""may offer to sell, from time to time, 325,442,152 shares."" Kraft Heinz shares fell nearly 4% to $22.85 after the announcement.Live EventsThere's no sign Berkshire has started selling yet, but CFRA Research analyst Cathy Seifert wonders if this could be just the beginning of a comprehensive review of Berkshire's varied holdings. In addition to its massive stock portfolio worth over $300 billion, Berkshire owns an assortment of insurers including Geico, several utilities, BNSF railroad and an eclectic mix of manufacturing and retail companies.""My sense is that Greg Abel's leadership style may be a departure from Buffett's, and this sale, if completed,",2026-01-22,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/warren-buffetts-successor-eyes-selling-off-berkshire-hathaways-325-million-kraft-heinz-shares/articleshow/126909405.cms,neutral,economictimes,,,,1
SMBC gets RBI’s in-principle nod for fully-owned India subsidiary,"MUMBAI: Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation (SMBC), Japan, on Wednesday received in-principle approval from the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) to set up a wholly owned subsidiary (WOS) in the country. ET had reported on June 2 that SMBC was preparing to approach the RBI for approval to convert its India operations into a WOS.The report had noted that once the Japanese lender secures approval to operate as a wholly owned subsidiary,State Bank of Indiaand other banks are likely to sell their remaining combined stake of nearly 14% inYes Bankto SMBC.Currently, SMBC holds close to a 25% stake in Yes Bank, most of which it acquired in May 2025. The move to transition from a branch-based presence to a full-fledged subsidiary would enable SMBC to acquire a majority stake in Yes Bank, the report had said. Yes Bank, however, has denied that any such plan is under way.In India, SMBC operates through four branches located in New Delhi, Mumbai, Chennai and Bengaluru, in addition to a branch at the International Financial Services Centre (IFSC) in GIFT City, Gujarat. ""The in-principle approval has been granted to the bank for setting up a wholly owned subsidiary through the conversion of its existing branches in India,"" the RBI said in a statement.Addas a Reliable and Trusted News SourceAdd Now!(You can now subscribe to ourETMarkets WhatsApp channel) (You can now subscribe to ourETMarkets WhatsApp channel)",2026-01-22,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/indias-central-bank-allows-japans-sumitomo-mitsui-banking-to-set-up-local-unit/articleshow/126536519.cms,neutral,economictimes,,,,1

"Asian shares set for weaker open, crude oil falls","Asia’s benchmark share index is set to slip from a record high after declines onWall Street, where investors rotated out of richly valuedtechnology stocks.Equity-index futures for Japan, Hong Kong and mainland China all fell after the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 Index dropped 1.1% on Wednesday. The S&P 500 closed 0.5% lower due to losses in the tech megacaps, even as a majority of companies rose. Contracts for US stocks slipped 0.2% in early Asian trading. Australian shares opened higher.Oil fell for the first time in six days after President Donald Trump said he’d been assured Iran would stop killing protesters, in a sign he may hold off on a threatened military response to the repression of demonstrations in the nation. West Texas Intermediate fell 1.7% Thursday. Elsewhere, gains in Treasuries pushed the 30-year yield to the lowest level this year.Asian shareshave outpaced gains on Wall Street this year on relatively cheaper valuations and optimism over the artificial-intelligence trade. In contrast, the first weeks of the year in the US have been marked by a rotation out of giant tech companies, whose all-weather earnings made them safe bets at times of economic uncertainty.“This is a demonstration of what occurs when rotation affects the stocks that dominate key indexes,” Steve Sosnick, chief strategist at Interactive Brokers, wrote in a note.Live EventsMeanwhile, theUS Supreme Courtdidn’t rule on challenges to Trump’s tariffs Wednesday, leaving the world to wait until at least next week to learn the fate of his signature economic policy.In Asia, theSouth Korean wonis in focus after US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent referred to excessive declines in the currency, offering rare verbal support as the won slides toward its weakest since 2009.“Bessent’s comments can support the won in the near term, but markets may have more influence if they feel the fundamentals and politics are still in a worsening trajectory,” said Brendan McKenna, a strategist at Wells Fargo in New",2026-01-22,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/asian-shares-set-for-weaker-open-crude-oil-falls/articleshow/126536949.cms,neutral,economictimes,,,,1

"Stocks in news: RIL, BHEL, NTPC, Bharat Forge, Ashok Leyland","Markets ended Thursday's session on a weaker note as selling pressure intensified, largely in response to feeble global cues.

"Tata Motors CV shares may rally 16%, says InCred; 4 reasons behind the ‘Add’ call","Shares of Tata Motors’ commercial vehicle business could rally as much as 16% from current levels, according to InCred Equities, which has initiated coverage on the stock with an Add rating, citing robust growth levers over the coming quarters. The domestic brokerage has set a price target of Rs 513 and outlined four key factors underpinning its bullish stance on the automobile major.CV upcycle just startingThe commercial vehicle (CV) business cycle appears to be turning, with momentum expected to build after a prolonged downcycle that played out over six quarters between April 2024 and July 2025. The Goods and Services Tax (GST) rate cut in September 2025 has significantly improved business economics for small transporters, triggering a revival in new truck demand.Savings from lower costs of tyres, lubricants and spare parts are expected to improve cash flows for small truck operators. Meanwhile, a reduction in vehicle prices should shorten payback periods, as these benefits are likely to be retained under the reverse charge mechanism of the GST regime. In addition, medium-term drivers such as easing interest rates and an improving Index of Industrial Production (IIP) are expected to sustain the demand recovery through FY28.Strong brand pullTata Motors is seen as better positioned to benefit from the recovery and potentially reverse its recent market share losses in the CV segment. Market share erosion during the downturn was more pronounced in trucks below 16 tonnes. However, with the demand revival likely to be led by small transporters and focused on small and medium trucks, Tata Motors’ wide product portfolio and strong brand recall offer a meaningful opportunity to regain lost share as the cycle turns.Sustained profitabilityA healthier demand environment is likely to result in lower discounts across the industry, supporting margin sustainability, the brokerage said in a note dated January 5.Live Events“Tata Motors’ EBITDA margin is marginally lower than that o",2026-01-22,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/tata-motors-cv-shares-may-rally-16-says-incred-4-reasons-behind-the-add-call/articleshow/126349223.cms,neutral,economictimes,,,,1

Market participants should note that the expiry of a lock-in does not imply immediate selling, only that the shares can now be traded in the open market.Meesho sharesare still up about 56% from their issue price of Rs 111, though they have retreated nearly 32% from a post-listing high of Rs 254.The company made its stock market debut on December 10, listing at a premium to its issue price and closing 53% higher on the first day of trade.

Venezuela’s stock market soars 50% in a day after Maduro’s arrest. What's behind the rally?,"TheVenezuela IBC Index, based in Caracas, jumped 50% in a single trading session on Tuesday, extending a blistering rally after a US attack led to the capture of long-standing President Nicolas Maduro, an event markets viewed as a potential turning point in the country’s political and economic trajectory.Tuesday’s surge followed a 16% gain on Monday and capped a string of sharp advances that began late last month. On Monday, December 29, the index rose 22%, followed by another 7% gain on Friday, January 2, when trading resumed after the New Year holiday. With the latest move, the benchmark is up 87% in just two trading sessions in January.The latest rally adds to extraordinary longer-term gains. Barring November 2025, the index rose in every month last year, delivering an annual return of 1,644%. According to available data, Venezuela’s stock market began trading in 2018. The index surged 4,400% in 2019 and 1,380% in 2020, and has since posted minimum annual returns of at least 100% over the next four years, with the lowest being 106% in 2024.Politics, oil and shifting expectationsThe market reaction followed a dramatic escalation over the weekend. The U.S. launched an attack on Venezuela on the intervening night of Friday and Saturday, leading to the arrest of Maduro along with his wife. Maduro now faces trial in the U.S. on various charges, including narco-terrorism.Investor focus has also shifted to oil flows and Washington’s next moves. Caracas and Washington have reached a deal to export up to $2 billion worth of Venezuelan crude to the United States, Trump said on Tuesday. The arrangement follows the weekend strike on Venezuela, as well as comments from the White House that the U.S. was examining options to acquire Greenland and that the use of the U.S. military toward that goal was “always an option”.Live EventsIn global markets, the reverberations were immediate.

Sun Pharma places non-binding offer for US-based Organon in its boldest global bet ever,"Davos/Mumbai: Dilip Shanghvi-ledSun Pharmaceutical Industries Ltdsubmitted a non-binding offer to acquire US-headquarteredOrganonon Thursday, said people in the know, pushing ahead with its boldest global bet ever.Sun has already tied up acquisition financing in the form of bridge loans from at least three global banks — one each from Wall Street, Europe and Japan — to the tune of $10-14 billion to show its commitment to the board of Organon.The due diligence process will start shortly, following which a binding bid will be made. But being a listed company, typically these dilligences are much shorter in nature.ET was the first to report January 19 on Sun making a play for Organon. The company told the exchanges the news was speculative and did not need any material disclosures.Sun Pharmaand Organon didn’t respond to ET’s queries.Sun's offer is an all-cash deal, said the people. Although the company had been evaluating Organon previously, Sun began serious pursuit in November-December, said the people cited. That’s when Organon decided to sell its JADA post-partum haemorrhage (PPH) treatment system to Laborie Medical for up to $465 million as it sought to pivot from women’s health devices to renew its focus on the women’s health biopharma range. Nexplanon is the company’s top-selling biopharma product, with revenue of $179 million in the second quarter of FY25.Live EventsOrganon is working with Morgan Stanley to find a buyer and Sun could find itself contending with competing bids from global pharma and PE consortia although there hasn’t been any interest from other companies in India, said the people cited. If successful, the deal will be the biggest by any Indian pharmaceutical company. In 2014, Sun acquired Ranbaxy from Daiichi Sankyo for $4 billion in an all-stock trade.Sun was little changed on Monday at Rs 1,673.55 (0.26%) on the BSE, for a market cap of $46.17 billion, in a declining market, following the ET report.

Kotak Mahindra Bank 5:1 stock split: What shareholders need to know before ex-date,"Investors looking to benefit fromKotak Mahindra Bank’s upcoming 5:1stock splitmust ensure they purchase the stock by the end of trading today. The bank has fixed Wednesday, January 14, 2026, as the record date to determine the list of eligibleshareholdersentitled to receive the split shares.As part of this corporate action, Kotak Mahindra Bank will be sub-dividing one existing equity share having a face value of Rs 5 into fiveequity shareshaving a face value of Rs 1 each.The stock will begin trading ex-split from January 14. The move effectively increases the number of shares in circulation while reducing the face value per share, with no change in the overall investment value for shareholders.According to Trendlyne data, this is the second time Kotak Mahindra Bank is undertaking a stock split. The previous split took place in September 2010, when the face value was revised from Rs 10 to Rs 5.What it means for shareholders?Live EventsFor a shareholder holding 50 shares of Kotak Mahindra Bank before the stock split, the 5:1 split means that each of their existing shares with a face value of Rs 5 will be converted into five shares with a face value of Rs 1.As a result, the total number of shares in their demat account will increase fivefold, from 50 shares to 250 shares. However, the overall value of their investment remains the same immediately after the split, since the market price of each share will adjust accordingly.For example, if the stock was trading at Rs 1,800 before the split, it would be expected to trade around Rs 360 post-split, ensuring the total value of the 250 shares equals that of the original 50 shares.Kotak Bank management changesIn a separate announcement, the bank has also strengthened its senior leadership team with the appointment ofAnup Kumar Sahaas Whole-time Director, subject to regulatory approvals.Until such approvals are in place, Anup will act as Whole-time Director (Designate) and will be a part of the senior management from January 1",2026-01-22,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/kotak-mahindra-bank-51-stock-split-what-shareholders-need-to-know-before-ex-date/articleshow/126495192.cms,neutral,economictimes,,,,1

"Sebi proposes Rs 20,000 crore threshold to consider a benchmark as 'Significant Indices'","Market regulator Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) has proposed an asset under management (AUM) threshold of Rs 20,000 crore to consider a benchmark or index as 'Significant Indices'.The move follows internal deliberations and discussions with the Association of Mutual Funds in India (AMFI) with a view to promote transparency and accountability in the governance and administration of indices in the securities market.The cumulative AUM for this purpose will be computed based on the daily average of AUM of domestic mutual funds schemes for each month of the past six months ending on June 30 and December 31 of every year, the regulator proposed in a consultation paper issued on Monday.The significant indices under the regulation were defined as the indices administered by an index provider, which are tracked or benchmarked by domestic mutual fund schemes with the cumulativeassets under managementexceeding the limits as may be specified from time to time.Sebi has notified theregulatory frameworkfor index providers in the securities market through the SEBI (Index Provider) Regulations, 2024.Live Events""In terms of Regulation 3(1), the Regulations shall be applicable only to Index Providers that administer Significant Indices consisting of securities listed on a recognized stock exchange in India for use in the Indian securities market,"" the consultation paper said.If a mutual fund scheme tracks more than one index or benchmark, the cumulative AUM for each index will be calculated by including only the portion of the scheme’s AUM linked to that specific index or benchmark, the consultation paper said.In case of index of indices, the cumulative AUM tracking such underlying indices would also include the AUM tracking such indices in proportion to the respective weights, the paper added.The providers of the 'Significant Indices' will be required to submit an application for registration as an Index Provider, in accordance with Regulation 4 of the SEBI (Index Prov",2026-01-22,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/sebi-proposes-framework-for-significant-indices-to-improve-governance-at-index-providers/articleshow/126678559.cms,neutral,economictimes,,,,1

Sebi proposes to simplify trading-related framework at stock exchanges,"Markets regulator Sebi on Friday proposed an overhaul of the trading-related framework at stock exchanges, aimed at simplifying rules, removing duplication, and reducing the compliance burden for market participants.The proposals are part of Sebi's broader push to facilitate ease of doing business across stock exchanges, including commodity derivatives exchanges.In its consultation paper, Sebi suggested merging multiple overlapping provisions on trading, price bands, circuit breakers, bulk and block deal disclosures, call auction mechanisms, liquidity enhancement schemes, margin trading facility (MTF), unique client code (UCC), PAN requirements, trading hours and daily price limits into a single, consolidated framework applicable to both equity and commodity segments.Provisions specifically applicable to clearing corporations should be carved out and moved into a dedicated master circular to avoid regulatory overlap, Sebi suggested.To improve transparency, Sebi proposed merging bulk and block deal disclosures and shifting dissemination to the client PAN level instead of the UCC level, thereby reducing manual reporting requirements for brokers.Live EventsThe regulator has suggested that market-wide circuit breaker rules, dynamic price band flexing, IPO price bands, and call auction procedures should be presented in tabular form, while several duplicative or outdated operational examples should be removed.The regulator has also proposed rationalising MTF norms, including raising the minimum net worth requirement for brokers from Rs 3 crore to Rs 5 crore or higher, as specified by exchanges.Timelines for submitting net-worth and auditor certificates should align with financial reporting cycles, and redundant due diligence clauses should be deleted.Obsolete market-making provisions for the cash segment should be removed and merged into a principle-based Liquidity Enhancement Scheme (LES) framework that now uniformly covers equities, derivatives, and commodities.Under th",2026-01-22,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/sebi-proposes-to-simplify-trading-related-framework-at-stock-exchanges/articleshow/126439286.cms,neutral,economictimes,,,,1

Vedanta shares jump 6% to record high after Nuvama raises target price to Rs 806,"Vedanta sharesjumped over 6% to a record high of Rs 678.50 on Wednesday, following Nuvama Institutional Equities’ revision of the stock’s target price to Rs 806, up from Rs 686.The brokerage cited value unlocking from the demerger and estimated the fair value of each entity under an FY28E sum-of-the-parts framework, maintaining Vedanta as a top pick.The stock’s rally was further supported by sustained gains in commodity prices, which pushed the company’s market capitalisation to Rs 2.5 lakh crore. Over the past twelve months, Vedanta has delivered returns exceeding 52%.According to Nuvama Institutional Equities, Vedanta is nearing the completion of regulatory approvals required for its demerger. Strong commodity prices, cost optimisation, and volume growth are expected to reinforce the company’s earlier investment thesis.The brokerage has revised its FY27E and FY28E EBITDA estimates upward by 17% and 8%, respectively, factoring in higher commodity prices. This implies a projected 20% CAGR in EBITDA from FY25 to FY28E. Considering value unlocking from the demerger, Nuvama assigns a sum-of-the-parts target price of Rs 806 per share, up from Rs 686, retaining Vedanta as a top pick.Live EventsHistorically, from FY16 to FY26, LME aluminium, zinc, and silver averaged $2,170 per tonne, $2,754 per tonne, and $22.7 per ounce, respectively. Amid anticipated global deficits in these metals in CY26, Vedanta expects sustained prices well above historical averages. Average prices for FY27E and FY28E are now projected at:- Aluminium: $3,000 and $2,750 per tonne- Zinc: $3,000 and $2,900 per tonne- Silver: $60 per ounceThe INR to USD exchange rate is assumed at 89 for FY27E and FY28E, up from 87.5 earlier.Higher commodity prices, aluminium cost reductions, and volume growth in international zinc and power operations are expected to drive a 20% EBITDA CAGR over FY25–FY28E, reaching Rs 724 billion.Debt allocation across the demerged entities is expected to be judicious, ensuring comfo",2026-01-22,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/vedanta-shares-rally-3-after-nuvama-gives-rs-806-target-price-on-demerger/articleshow/126517998.cms,neutral,economictimes,,,,1

Do mergers & acquisitions indicate the worst is behind this once-high flying sector? 5 QSR stocks with upside potential of up to 32%,"A hint of change in the fortunes of some sectors comes from unusual events. One of them is mergers and acquisitions. There is enough evidence to show that when a sector witnesses heightened M&A activity, it may either be at its peak or scraping the bottom. There is a logical reason for this. When things stay tough for a sector, many investors or promoters get frustrated and are happy to move out.

SIP stocks! HDFC Securities names 10 companies to accumulate in 2026. Check details,"Amid heightened volatility in early 2026, HDFC Securities has identified 10 stocks to accumulate through 2026, spanning small-, mid- and large-cap companies across sectors. The picks are anchored in strong fundamentals, healthy balance sheets and long-term earnings visibility, offering investors a disciplined way to navigate market swings and build wealth over the year. HDFC says the international business remains well-diversified, with no single geography outside of Europe and Canada accounting for 5% of total sales. Emcure’s product portfolio in international markets comprises a mix of specialty branded generics, injectables and generic products. The company has built a complex portfolio (40% of export sales), comprising chiral molecules, injectable, iron compounds and biologics. The company reiterated its guidance to reach Rs 10,000 crore in revenue for Paints (and turn the segment profitable) in FY28. Management indicated revenue market share (including putty revenue) has crossed 10% in the organised decorative paints market. While we stay optimistic, further revenue traction in paints remains the key monitorable. The company has been able to roll-out CNG and PNG distribution network across authorised GAs by installing infrastructure such as pipeline network, compressor stations and a marketing network. IGL has 954 CNG stations (FY24: 882), 12,049 Industrial and commercial PNG connections and 30.70 lakh domestic PNG connections as on Mar. 31, 2025. Its brownfield expansion at Angul is set to double crude steel capacity from 6 MTPA to 12 MTPA by FY26E, taking total capacity to 15.9 MTPA, with a further ramp-up to 25.2 MTPA by 2030 through an investment of about Rs 70,000 crore. The expansion is seen as a key re-rating trigger, aided by the government’s infrastructure push and rising per capita steel consumption. It has a strong position in the domestic market and a geographically diversified presence through its subsidiaries. Backed by decades of operating experi",2026-01-22,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/sip-stocks-hdfc-securities-names-10-companies-to-accumulate-in-2026-check-details/slideshow/126613282.cms,neutral,economictimes,,,,1

Multibagger watchlist: 10 stocks surge over 20% for 3 straight quarters in FY26. Do you own any?,"Amid the bustling floors of the BSE, FY26 witnessed a rare phenomenon: out of thousands of listed stocks, only about ten truly stood out. Each of these companies had a market capitalisation exceeding Rs 2,000 crore and posted share price growth of over 20% in three consecutive quarters: April-June, July-September, and October-December.To avoid chasing thinly traded outliers, the analysis focused exclusively on actively traded stocks, those moving at least 5,000 shares in recent sessions.

"Emkay upgrades Bajaj Auto shares to buy rating, sees 17% upside. Here’s why analysts are bullish","After a muted 2025, which saw gains of just 6%,Bajaj Auto sharesclimbed as much as 3% to their day’s high of Rs 9,783 on Tuesday, after Emkay upgraded the stock to Buy from Add, citing robust growth prospects in the coming quarters.With a price target of Rs 11,100 per share, the brokerage firm has forecasted an upside of 17% from current market levels. Here are three reasons why the domestic brokerages are bullish on the two-wheeler major OEM.2W market share stabilising; premium traction improvesBajaj Auto’s domestictwo-wheeler market shareappears to have bottomed out, rising to 10.5% in December 2025 from 10% in Q2FY25, Emkay said in a note earlier today. While domestic motorcycle dispatch growth has remained in the low single digits over the past 15 months, performance was weighed down by continued market-share losses in the economy segment, which formed 11% of volumes in Q3FY26TD versus 14% in Q3FY25. That said, a sequential recovery in overall market share is visible, led by 125cc and premium motorcycles, where shares improved to 21.9% and 22.2% respectively in Q3FY26TD from 21.1% and 21.9% in Q2FY26.Export dispatches also remained strong, growing about 24% year-on-year in December 2025. In electric two-wheelers,Bajaj Autoretained the number-two position with around 19% market share in December, supported by a sharper focus on newer Pulsar and Chetak models, with three to four launches lined up in Q4.Live EventsMoves past M&M in E-3Ws; currency tailwinds support marginsIn the rapidly expanding electric three-wheeler segment, where penetration stands at roughly 33% for FY26 and 37% in Q3, Bajaj Auto has overtaken M&M to emerge as the market leader as of December 2025, with an estimated 32% market share.

Nomura sued by Adani-linked fund accused in short-seller Hindenburg report,"Nomura Holdings Inc.’s loans to an investment fund embroiled in a short-selling firm’s allegations against Indian billionaire Gautam Adani have come under scrutiny in a London lawsuit.Some three years after Adani first faced questions about fraud and stock manipulation at his ports-to-power conglomerate, Tokyo-based Nomura was sued by a fund owned by Elara Capital Plc over an urgent cash demand that allegedly cost it tens of millions of dollars.The Elara fund, known asOyster Bay FundLtd., borrowed from Nomura for stock bets onAdani Enterprises Ltd. andAdani Ports& Special Economic Zone Ltd., according to High Court filings from the case. Shares in those companies plunged after a January 2023 report by Hindenburg Research accused Adani’s empire of “brazen stock manipulation” and alleged Elara was involved.Some of Nomura’s most senior bankers in Asia were spooked and wanted to cut the size of the loans, according to the bank’s defense filed Jan. 5. The Elara fund claimed that the bank requested $205 million in cash to recoup the debts but then breached a repayment plan by selling Adani shares that had been pledged as collateral — a move that resulted in losses of $43 million. The Tokyo-based lender has denied any wrongdoing.The case is part of the fallout from Hindenburg’s almost 100-page report on Adani, which at one point eroded more than $150 billion of value from his Adani Group’s publicly-traded entities and triggered local regulatory probes — including one involving Elara. Asia’s second-richest man rejected the report as “baseless” and “nothing short of a calculated securities fraud.”Live EventsThe filings also show how Nomura dealt with loans to its high-risk trading clients in 2023, two years after losing almost $3 billion on similar trades with Archegos Capital Management.Within days of theHindenburg report, a group of Nomura’s top Asian officials including head of equity-product sales Ajay Jain, Asia markets sales co-heads Corrinne Teo and Charles Myong and",2026-01-22,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/nomura-sued-by-adani-linked-fund-accused-in-short-seller-report/articleshow/126799315.cms,neutral,economictimes,,,,1

Banks to review Vodafone Idea funding plan after AGR relief,"Mumbai: Banks led byState Bank of Indiawill reassess extending fresh funds toVodafone Ideaafter the government last week approved a relief package freezing the telco’s adjusted gross revenue (AGR) dues and stretching repayment over 16 years.Bankers said the decision has altered the company's liability profile, adding that clarity on its funding needs and future business plans are crucial for considering fresh funding.Banks have been wary of lending to Vi because of its huge liabilities, majorly consisting of statutory dues including deferred spectrum payment and AGR liabilities, strained cash flows, and doubts about its ability to service new loans. “Our team will reassess (extending fresh funds) in the light of the new developments,” a senior bank executive familiar with the details said.“Vi required Rs 35,000 crore, according to the plans shared by the company previously. We need to figure out how much they need now and how much is viable based on the firm's cash flows,” the banker told ET on condition of anonymity. “It’s a big amount and will have to come from a consortium of lenders for which banks will have to meet and decide.”Staggered RepaymentsLive EventsLead lenderSBIdid not reply to an email seeking comment. Last week, the Department of Telecommunications (DoT) froze Vi’s AGR dues of Rs 87,695 crore for the period from 2006-07 to 2018-19, and allowed staggered repayments over 16 years until 2041. Under the revised schedule, Vi will pay Rs 124 crore annually for six years between March 2026 and 2031, followed by Rs 100 crore per year for four years from March 2032-35.The remaining amount will be repaid in equal annual instalments over six years from March 2036-41, after a DoT-appointed committee reassesses the final liability, the filing said. This means nearly 95% of Vi’s AGR liability of Rs 87,695 crore will remain frozen for the next decade. “This is a significant development as it deals with a big overhang,” a second bank executive said. “Vi needs funds",2026-01-22,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/banks-to-review-vodafone-idea-funding-plan-after-agr-relief/articleshow/126473430.cms,neutral,economictimes,,,,1

Asian stocks rise to extend record global rally,"Asian equities edged up at the open Tuesday, extending a record-breaking run forglobal equitiesas investors looked pastgeopolitical concerns.The MSCI Asia Pacific Index extended its advance to a fourth day, led by a 1% gain for theNikkei 225 Index. Shares edged lower in South Korea and Australia. Equity-index futures pointed to gains for China after shares rallied on Wall Street, with megacaps such as Amazon.com Inc. and Tesla Inc. among the winners.Gold and silver gave up some of the gains that came after the US capture ofVenezuela’s President Nicolas Maduro. Treasuries steadied after the 10-year yield fell three basis points on Monday, when a report showed US manufacturing activity shrank in December by the most since 2024. That supported the case for more easing by the Federal Reserve.“The bullish case for equities remains intact,” said Adrian Helfert, chief investment officer at Westwood. “Broader market leadership should look past Venezuela entirely unless cascading geopolitical events emerge.”This is poised to be a “strong year” forrisk assets— the triumvirate of easing fiscal, monetary, and regulatory policy should work together in a pro-cyclical way, Morgan Stanley’s Serena Tang and Seth Carpenter wrote in a note Monday.Live EventsFor stocks, the main themes, in the US especially, will be stronger earnings growth and broadening leadership, while AI financing and a revival of M&A will take center stage in credit markets. The analysts are overweight on global equities.“Macro concerns still matter, but micro will become a larger driver of asset returns in this cyclical recovery,” they said.The bullish attitude showed up in equity derivatives as well.A “mix of momentum chasing and rebound plays reflects a more constructive tone than most of 2025, with sentiment and positioning turning decisively less bearish,” said derivatives strategist Chris Murphy of Susquehanna International Group, in a note Monday. “That optimism is showing up clearly in options activity, w",2026-01-22,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/asian-stocks-rise-to-extend-record-global-rally/articleshow/126363690.cms,neutral,economictimes,,,,1

The move is aimed at ensuring smooth polling for civic elections scheduled for January 15, with counting of votes slated on January 16.Among the civic bodies headed for polls is the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC), which governs India’s financial capital and is considered one of the country’s most politically influential urban institutions. The BMC also oversees a sizeable annual budget of over Rs 74,000 crore. In total, elections will be held for the BMC and 28 other municipal corporations across Maharashtra on January 15.What about the stock market?While the holiday notification settles administrative arrangements, uncertainty continues over banking and financial market operations on that day. The stock exchanges have yet to issue any clarification, and neither the BSE nor the NSE has declared January 15 a trading holiday. This is particularly significant because the date coincides with the weekly expiry of Sensex derivatives. No official circular on market closure has been released so far, and January 15, 2026, does not appear as a holiday in the current exchange calendars. The Multi-Commodity Exchange (MCX) has also not marked the day as a trading holiday.As of now, the Reserve Bank of India has not issued any communication on whether banks will remain open or closed on January 15, 2026. Traditionally, RBI-regulated markets—such as government securities, the call money market, triparty repo and",2026-01-22,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/will-bse-nse-be-closed-on-january-15-as-maharashtra-declares-civic-poll-holiday/articleshow/126410428.cms,neutral,economictimes,,,,1

"Stock Market Holiday: Indian stock exchanges NSE, BSE to be closed for trading today for Maharashtra Municipal elections; Check Full List","Indian stock exchanges, BSE and NSE, will remain shut today, January 15, in view of the municipal corporation elections being held across Maharashtra. Trading across all segments, including equities, equity derivatives, commodity derivatives, and electronic gold receipts, will remain suspended for the day.Both exchanges issued revised circulars confirming the trading holiday. The BSE clarified that equity derivatives contracts originally scheduled to expire on January 15, were revised to expire a day earlier, on January 14.NSE too updated its earlier stance, designating January 15 as a full trading holiday in the capital market and F&O segment.This marks a revision from earlier communication last week, where the day was only classified as a settlement holiday, usually implying that trading would continue while settlements pause due to banking operations.However, with banks in Maharashtra expected to remain closed today due to the civic polls, both stock exchanges revised their position to a full holiday.Live EventsMCXMeanwhile, commodity trading on the Multi-Commodity Exchange (MCX) will be partially operational. As per a circular issued, the exchange will remain shut for the morning session (9:00 AM to 5:00 PM) due to polling.Trading in bullion contracts like gold and silver will commence only in the evening session, which operates from 5:00 PM to 11:55 PM.

"Union Budget FY27: These 6 calls could end the fiscal drag, Nuvama says","India’s economy may be bottoming out, but without fresh policy support the recovery risks losing steam. In its FY27 Budget preview,Nuvama Institutional Equitieslays out six expectations that frame how Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman could try to revive growth, without blowing a hole in the fiscal math. From halting fiscal consolidation and lifting capex to betting on disinvestment, deregulation and targeted sector pushes, the brokerage argues that FY27 could mark the end of years of fiscal drag.The Union Budget is likely to mark a turning point from years of fiscal tightening, but the shift may not be strong enough to change market positioning meaningfully, according to Nuvama Institutional Equities. While higher development spending and capex are welcome, the brokerage said they may still fall short of arresting the ongoingearnings downgrade cycle, as margins are poised for mean reversion and external headwinds remain. As a result, Nuvama continues to maintain a defensive bias, preferring telecom, internet, IT, consumer, cement and chemicals, while staying underweight on BFSI, autos, industrials and power.The brokerage said the economy is “bottoming out”, but growth impulses remain weak despite last year’s tax cuts, making complementary fiscal support critical as global uncertainties linger. Nuvama expects the Centre to retain the gross fiscal deficit (GFD) target at 4.4% of GDP in FY27, unchanged from FY26, thereby ending the negative fiscal impulse of recent years, even as it cautioned that a modest fiscal push may not be sufficient to drive a sharp top-line recovery for India Inc.1) Fiscal consolidation pausesNuvama expects the finance minister to “abstain from further fiscal consolidation” in FY27, keeping the GFD at 4.4% of GDP. With five years of tightening behind it, the brokerage says fiscal drag should fade, turning the fiscal impulse neutral from negative. The removal of the GST compensation cess alone could add about 0.2% of GDP in support to the eco",2026-01-22,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/union-budget-fy27-these-6-calls-could-end-the-fiscal-drag-nuvama-says/articleshow/126983458.cms,neutral,economictimes,,,,1

Tata Elxsi Q3 PAT slumps 45% YoY; brokerages flag 22% downside risk — here’s what they say,"Tata Elxsireported a 45.3% year-on-year drop in net profit for the December quarter, impacted by an exceptional charge of Rs 956.9 million following changes in India’s labour laws.The firm posted a profit of Rs 1.09 billion in Q3, lower than a year earlier, citing one-time increases in employee benefit provisions arising from revised wage structures mandated under the new labour codes.The earnings miss triggered a 3.2% fall in Tata Elxsi’s shares to an intraday low of Rs 5,609.15 on the BSE.Meanwhile, some brokerages have raised their price targets following better-than-expected revenue and margin performance; others remain cautious, citing valuation concerns and muted medium-term visibility in key segments such as Media & Communications and Healthcare.Morgan Stanley: Underweight| Target price: Rs 5,350 | Downside potential: 7.7%Live EventsMorgan Stanley has maintained an Underweight rating on Tata Elxsi with a target price of ₹5,350. The brokerage said growth trends in Q3 were better than expected and highlighted positive margin surprises, driven by utilisation rising to 75%, ahead of its earlier estimates for Q4 FY26.It highlighted management’s optimism in the auto sector and a potential recovery in healthcare and media segments from Q4FY26, supported by large media deal wins. Morgan Stanley forecasted that utilization would reach 80% in the next two quarters and settle at 85% over the medium term. However, it remains unconvinced, citing rich valuations and an unfavourable risk-reward profile without material signs of sustainable growth.PL Capital: Hold| Target price: Rs 5,500 | Downside potential: 5%PL Capital has a Hold rating on Tata Elxsi with a raised target price of Rs 5,500. The firm noted that revenue performance (+3.2% QoQ CC) exceeded its estimates due to strong growth in the Transportation vertical. It attributed the momentum to anchor account ramp-ups and recovery in strategic top clients, though ex-top 10 accounts saw a 7.5% decline.PL Capital flagged",2026-01-22,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/tata-elxsi-q3-pat-slumps-45-yoy-brokerages-flag-22-downside-risk-heres-what-they-say/articleshow/126519765.cms,neutral,economictimes,,,,1

Reliance Retail-owned stock tanks 10% as Q3 net profit plummets 97% to Rs 14 lakh,"Shares ofRelianceRetail-ownedLotus Chocolate Companynosedived 10% to close the session at Rs 677 on January 13 after the company’s net profit took a massive 97% hit in the third quarter of the financial year 2026.The company’s net profit stood at Rs 14 lakh, down by 96% year-on-year, Lotus said in a regulatory filing. In the same quarter last year, the company reported a net profit of Rs 3.72 crore.Lotus reported revenue from operations of Rs 142 crore for the quarter under review, down 14% from Rs 165 crore in the corresponding quarter of the previous fiscal year.On the other hand, EBITDA margin witnessed a marginal uptick of 20 basis points to 4%. One percent (1%) is equal to 100 basis points (bps). EBITDA is earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation.“Amid heightened commodity price volatility, Lotus actively hedged its exposure to commodity price dislocations to limit downside risk. Despite operating through an unfavourable phase of the commodity cycle and a constrained liquidity environment, the company delivered a PBT of Rs 53 lakh for the quarter compared to Rs 3.7 Crore in 3Q FY25. The company stayed focused on margin protection during the period,” the company said in an exchange filing.Live EventsAs part of its longer-term growth plans, the company is also undertaking a phased modernisation of its existing plant and machinery after a detailed review. While these initiatives are intended to position the business ahead of the festival-led demand season, limited and planned production disruptions could weigh on near-term performance. Over time, a larger contribution from consumer brands is expected to support structurally higher margins, reduce exposure to commodity cycles and strengthen the company’s competitive positioning and shareholder returns.Following early validation of its consumer business in select geographies this year, Lotus Chocolate Company is now focused on scaling up its B2C consumer franchise.

221% gain in 2026? InCred Equities picks 6 smallcap stocks to bet on this year,"After a bruising 2025 that saw the smallcap index slip nearly 6% and underperform the Nifty, investor sentiment around the segment has remained cautious. However, looking ahead to 2026, InCred Equities believes select opportunities are emerging across the smallcap space. In a recent report, the brokerage has identified six smallcap stocks spanning multiple sectors that could offer value and potentially deliver returns of up to a staggering 221% over the next year. Here’s the full list. With a target price of Rs 474 per share, the brokerage implies an upside potential of a massive 221% from current market levels. Its revenue is expected to rise at an 18.8% CAGR over FY26 to FY28, driven by sales of vanillin & blends. The EBITDA margin is expected to expand, from 10% in FY25F to 21.8% in FY28F, resulting in a robust 56.8% EBITDA CAGR. InCred Equities has a target price of Rs 1,850, translating to an upside potential of 94%. Margins are benefiting from the normalisation of fuel costs and a decline in maize prices following the kharif harvest season. As a result, the company’s manufacturing margin for ethanol and ENA improved sharply to Rs 5 per litre in 2QFY26, from Rs 2 per litre in FY25, with further gradual improvement expected through FY26. The brokerage has a target price of Rs 2,051, implying an upside of 70.4%, InCred Equities said in a note. Strong demand in mining, infrastructure, and specialty chemicals sectors is expected to continue driving growth, bolstered by India’s coal production growth target of 1.5 billion tonnes by FY30, increasing TAN consumption. With a price target of Rs 4,100 per share, analysts forecast an upside potential of 34.1%. The company is well-placed to participate in a broader recovery in the FMCG industry. With the outlook for 2H expected to be better for FMCG majors in terms of volume growth, the company should benefit. The brokerage has assigned a target price of Rs 325 per share, implying an upside potential of 24%.

"Gainers & Losers: Eternal, Amagi Media among 7 stocks under spotlight on Wednesday","Jan 21, 2026 Shares of Eternal, previously Zomato, rallied as much as 6.2% to Rs 287.20 on the NSE on Wednesday before settling with gains of 5% at Rs 282.80. The rally was in anticipation of strong earnings. The company reported a 73% YoY rise in consolidated net profit to Rs 102 crore. Revenue from operations surged 201% YoY to Rs 16,315 crore. Image Source: ETMarkets.com Shares of CreditAccess Grameen ended 10% higher at Rs 1,365 on Wednesday after foreign brokerages HSBC and CLSA upgraded the stock to 'Buy' following its December quarter earnings. HSBC forecasts a 31% upside from the last closing price of Rs 1,240 while CLSA pegs a 17% upside. Image Source: ETMarkets.com Shares of Kalyan Jewellers tumbled as much as 12% to Rs 397.20 on the NSE, continuing its bearish run on Dalal Street for a 9th consecutive session. With today’s fall, the counter is down 25% over the same period. In the first 14 sessions in 2026, the stock has ended in the green only three times. A possible reason behind the decline could be gold prices surging to fresh record highs of nearly Rs 1.6 lakh per 10 grams, likely hitting the business. Image Source: ETMarkets.com Shares of Amagi Media Labs were listed at a 12% discount on the NSE at Rs 318 versus the issue price of Rs 361.

Image Source: ETMarkets.com Shares of Mangalore Refinery and Petrochemicals Ltd (MRPL) ended 10% higher at Rs 153.20 on the NSE on Wednesday. The sharp rebound followed a three-day losing streak. The recent decline was triggered by comments from company executives stating that MRPL, a state-run oil refiner and fuel retailer, is not importing Russian crude due to Western sanctions and is exploring purchases of Venezuelan oil.

12 penny stocks rally up to 589% in FY26 so far; 6 turn multibaggers. Do you own any?,"So far in FY26, 12 penny stocks have posted sharp gains, with returns ranging from 40% to as high as 589%. Notably, six of them have emerged as multibaggers. These standout performers were selected based on specific criteria: a market capitalisation below Rs 1,000 crore, a share price under Rs 20, and a minimum recent trading volume of 5 lakh shares. This analysis focuses on identifying low-priced, actively traded micro-cap stocks that demonstrate strong upward momentum. (Data Source: ACE Equity).Penny stocks often attract attention due to their low entry price and the potential for explosive growth. But while the rewards can be impressive, the risks are equally high. These stocks typically carry low liquidity, high volatility, and limited financial transparency.

"Export-heavy stocks bleed on Trump's 500% tariff signal; Gokaldas, Avanti crack up to 12%","Export-oriented stocks came under sharp selling pressure on Thursday after fresh political signals from the US raised fears of extremely high import duties, unnerving investors already wary of global trade risks. Shares of seafood exporters, textile makers, pharmaceutical companies, and metal producers fell across the board as markets reacted to the possibility of tariffs rising up to 500% under a proposed US sanctions framework.The trigger for the sell-off was a statement by US Senator Lindsey Graham, who said that US President Donald Trump had given the green light to a bipartisan Russia sanctions bill.The proposed legislation seeks to sharply raise duties on Russian imports into the United States to at least 500% of their value and could be used as leverage against countries such as India, China, and Brazil that continue to buy Russian oil.The senator indicated that the bill could be brought to a bipartisan vote as early as next week and expressed confidence in strong cross-party backing. He described the proposed law as a critical diplomatic tool linked to negotiations surrounding the Russia-Ukraine conflict.Meanwhile, Trump has warned of higher tariffs on Indian goods if New Delhi does not address US concerns related to Russian crude imports. Currently, the US has already imposed tariffs of up to 50% on certain Indian products, with roughly half of that directly linked to India’s purchases of Russian oil.Live EventsAlso Read:Sensex tumbles 1,500 points in 4 days, Rs 7 lakh crore erased: Trump tariffs, 5 other reasons behind market sell-offShrimp stocks fall the mostSeafood exporters were among the most severely affected during the session.Avanti Feedsfell 7%, whileApex Frozen Foodsalso dropped 7%.Coastal Corporationdeclined 2%, Waterbase slipped 1%, and Sharat Industries lost 1.4%.Investors fear that any escalation in tariffs or sanctions could directly hit shrimp exports to the US, which remains the most important market for Indian seafood companies.Pharma sto",2026-01-22,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/export-heavy-stocks-bleed-on-trumps-500-tariff-signal-gokaldas-avanti-crack-up-to-12/articleshow/126410040.cms,neutral,economictimes,,,,1

Balu Forge shares plunge 20%. Is the rout done or is more pain ahead?,"Balu Forge Industries share pricesank as much as 20% on Wednesday, sliding to Rs 466.85 on the BSE, as heavy selling pressure pushed the stock deeper into a prolonged downtrend and left investors questioning whether the steep correction has further to run.The sharp fall came with elevated trading activity. About 50.66 lakh shares changed hands on the NSE, with turnover of roughly Rs 248.59 crore, even as there was no immediate company-specific trigger identified for the day’s decline. The sell-off knocked the company’s total market capitalisation down to Rs 5,304.04 crore.Prolonged slide weighs on sentimentWednesday’s drop extended a losing streak that has now stretched to six consecutive trading sessions, during which the stock has shed nearly 23%. Over a longer horizon, the picture is even more sobering: Balu Forge shares are down 38% over the past one year and have fallen 32% in the last six months, signalling sustained pressure oninvestor confidence.From a technical standpoint, the stock is firmly in bearish territory. It is currently trading below all eight key simple moving averages, including the 5-day, 10-day, 20-day, 30-day, 50-day, 100-day, 150-day and 200-day SMAs, pointing to weakness across short-, medium- and long-term charts.Live EventsMomentum indicators also remain negative. The Relative Strength Index stands at 36.4, with readings below 30 typically considered oversold and above 70 overbought. Meanwhile, the Moving Average Convergence Divergence is at -9.4 and remains below both the centre and signal lines, reinforcing a strong bearish signal.Recent defence milestone fails to arrest fallThe sell-off comes despite a positive operational update last month. In December 2025, Balu Forge said it had begun operations of its fully indigenously developed empty shell production line at its greenfield manufacturing campus in Belgaum,Karnataka, a move described as a significant milestone for India’s defence manufacturing ecosystem.The production line, among t",2026-01-22,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/balu-forge-shares-plunge-20-is-the-rout-done-or-is-more-pain-ahead/articleshow/126387564.cms,neutral,economictimes,,,,1

Stock-picking on your own? Kotak Equities flags more pain in top 20 retail-heavy stocks,"In the last year, the underperformance of the Indian stock market has caused retail investors to bear the brunt of actual returns earned, even as headline returns remained steady. An analysis of direct and indirect holdings of retail investors byKotak Equitiesshowed that most retail portfolios have delivered weak or barely positive returns over the past 16-18 months.A Kotak Equities study shows that the top 20 retail-heavy stocks in the Nifty-500 have posted negative returns since June 2024, after a strong run-up between March 2023 and June 2024, with similar patterns seen in high retail-owned “narrative stocks.”Among these stocks,Reliance Infrastructure, where retail investors hold around 45%, slipped 13% from June 2024 to December 2025. Olectra Greentec fell 34% over the same timeframe, andTata Technologiesdeclined 36%. That said, not all stocks in the basket underperformed —HBL EngineeringandAnand Rathi Wealthstood out with gains of 69% and 54%, respectively.Crucially, the brokerage warned that valuations in many of these narrative-driven stocks remain disconnected from underlying fundamentals, even after recent corrections triggered by the failure of growth or turnaround stories.""These stocks are likely to lose a significant portion of their market cap over time, potentially prolonging the period of weak returns for retail investors,"" it said.Live EventsIndian markets have been dubbed the world's worst-performing in 2025, and the start to 2026 has been anything but good. Nifty lost over 2% already this year, dragged down by continuous foreign investor exits that started early last year.Even the returns over the last few months through institutions remained uneven. The brokerage said that retail investors' direct equity holdings, as well as investments routed through mutual funds (MFs) and portfolio management services (PMS), have trailed benchmark indices and tested investor patience during a prolonged phase of time correction in the broader market.As per the re",2026-01-22,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/stock-picking-on-your-own-kotak-equities-flags-more-pain-in-top-20-retail-heavy-stocks/articleshow/126677466.cms,neutral,economictimes,,,,1

Market Trading Guide: Buy BSE and Coal India on Tuesday for up to 10% gains,"Nifty ended its five-session losing streak on Monday, settling with gains as buying in financials and consumer stocks supported the markets despite selling pressure in auto and IT stocks.Decoding the Nifty chart, Rupak De, Senior Technical Analyst at LKP Securities said the index formed a piercing line pattern on the daily chart, suggesting a possible bullish reversal after a few days of selling pressure. ""On the hourly chart, the RSI has moved out of the oversold zone, indicating early signs of recovery. However, this half session buying is not expected to change overall market sentiment. We will remain watchful, as the Nifty faces resistance in the 26,000–26,100 zone, where selling pressure may re-emerge.

Dr Reddy's Q3 preview: PAT may fall 22% YoY as US pressure to weigh on earnings,"Dr Reddy's Laboratoriesis expected to report a muted performance in the December quarter, with pressure from the US business offsetting steady growth in India and Europe. On average, five brokerages expect consolidated revenue to decline about 1% year on year in Q3, while profit after tax is seen falling 22% from a year ago, reflecting a lower contribution from gRevlimid and margin compression.North America: Revlimid drag dominatesThe US business is expected to remain the key drag on overall performance. Axis Securities expects US sales of around $310 million, with gRevlimid limits resulting in a negligible contribution during the quarter. Kotak Equities models slightly higher North America sales of $325 million, but still estimates a sharp 13% quarter-on-quarter decline due to pricing pressure and erosion in the base business.Motilal Oswal is more cautious, projecting a 21.6% year-on-year decline in North America sales to about $310 million, led by intensified pricing pressure on gRevlimid. YES Securities also notes that Revlimid will no longer be a meaningful contributor after more than two years of sales, exposing the underlying growth trajectory of the US base portfolio.Brokerages broadly agree that the absence of Revlimid will continue to weigh on growth, keeping the US business subdued in the near term.Live EventsIndia: A relative bright spotIndia is expected to remain the strongest contributor to growth in Q3. Axis Securities expects around 10% growth, driven by strong traction in cardiac, pain management, and vaccination segments. Kotak Equities forecasts even stronger momentum, modelling 13% year-on-year growth in domestic sales.Motilal Oswal expects the India business to grow 11% year on year, supported by robust demand in vaccines, cardiac therapies, and pain management. Analysts view India as a structurally strong market for Dr Reddy's, with differentiated launches and chronic therapies continuing to gain traction.Europe and other markets: Steady expansi",2026-01-22,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/dr-reddys-q3-preview-pat-may-fall-22-yoy-as-us-pressure-to-weigh-on-earnings/articleshow/126768651.cms,neutral,economictimes,,,,1

"India’s defence order pipeline hits record levels; Astra Microwave, Bharat Dynamics top buys","India’s defence manufacturing sector is witnessing a sharp improvement in medium-term visibility, driven by a significant acceleration in capital acquisition approvals.The Defence Acquisition Council (DAC) has cleared capital proposals worth about Rs 790 billion in its winter session, taking FY26 year-to-date approvals to nearly Rs 3.3 trillion—almost twice the annual defence capital outlay of Rs 1.8 trillion.While these approvals represent Acceptance of Necessity rather than immediate orders, the scale and diversity materially de-risk order inflows for the sector over the next two to four years.The latest approvals span munitions, missiles, air defence systems, surveillance and communication equipment, training systems, unmanned platforms and naval support assets. This reflects a balanced modernisation push across the Army, Navy and Air Force, rather than isolated platform-led spending.Importantly, the pipeline covers both high-value marquee programs and recurring electronics- and systems-led procurement, supporting steadier execution and revenue visibility for defence manufacturers.Live EventsThe extension of the emergency procurement window until mid-January 2026 further underpins near-term activity, enabling fast-track purchases of critical equipment and mitigating delays that could have emerged as earlier deadlines lapsed.The primary growth driver remains sustained policy focus on operational readiness amid a fluid security environment, coupled with increasingrelianceon indigenous platforms and systems.Large-ticketmissile and air defenceprograms, integrated electronic warfare systems, and unmanned and counter-unmanned solutions form a substantial portion of the approval pipeline.However, execution timelines remain a key challenge, as AoN approvals must still navigate contracting, production ramp-ups and delivery schedules. Budgetary allocations in the coming years and the pace of conversion from approvals to firm orders will be critical determinants of realised",2026-01-22,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/indias-defence-order-pipeline-hits-record-levels-astra-microwave-bharat-dynamics-top-buys/articleshow/126448195.cms,neutral,economictimes,,,,1

"IDFC First Bank shares can rally 23%, says Nomura after initiating coverage with Buy call","Private sector lenderIDFC First Bank sharesgained over 1% to Rs 86.20 per share after international brokerage firm Nomura initiated coverage with a Buy call, citing positive growth levers in the coming quarters.With a target price of Rs 105, analysts implied an upside potential of 23.5% from current market levels.Nomura said growth visibility remains strong, with loans and deposits expected to clock CAGRs of 20% and 22%, respectively, over FY26-28F. The bank’s fee income profile, at over 2% of average assets, remains superior to peers.In addition, a 35 basis points decline in credit costs is likely to support a sharp improvement in profitability, lifting RoA and RoE to 1.2% and 1.8% by FY28, respectively, from 0.6% and 5.4% in FY26. This earnings acceleration is expected to translate into a sector-leading EPS CAGR of 67% over FY26-28F.Operating expenses remained elevated during FY19-25 as the bank invested across branches, manpower, technology and multiple new businesses. Operating leverage is now becoming visible at the segment level across retail liabilities, assets and credit cards, though this has not yet fully reflected in headline ratios due to strong growth in these segments. As growth normalises and scale benefits kick in, cost efficiency is expected to improve, with cost-to-assets and cost-to-income ratios declining to 5.1% and 64% by FY28F, from 5.6% and 71% in FY26F, respectively.Live EventsNet interest margin (NIM) pressure witnessed over FY25-H1FY26, driven by repo-linked repricing and loan mix effects, is largely absorbed. As term deposits reprice, NIMs are expected to bottom out in FY26, recover gradually through FY27 and stabilise thereafter. Potential savings account rate cuts provide additional upside, with a 50-100 bps reduction potentially adding 17-33 bps to margins and 12-23 bps to RoAs.Asset quality stress has largely been confined to the microfinance (MFI) portfolio, where the bank has already taken corrective measures. Stress in credit cards",2026-01-22,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/idfc-first-bank-shares-can-rally-23-says-nomura-after-initiating-coverage-with-buy-call/articleshow/126386859.cms,neutral,economictimes,,,,1

NSE IPO proxy play! Why smallcap IFCI shares jumped 26% in just 1 week,"Amid comments from Sebi chief Tuhin Kanta Pandey that the capital markets regulator may approve the much-awaited IPO of the National Stock Exchange (NSE) this month, shares of smallcapIFCIhave rallied around 26% in the last one week alone. The PSU stock rallied over 10% to Rs 62.56 on BSE this morning, but is down 1% in the last six months.The NBFC holds an indirect stake in NSE via Stock Holding Corporation of India (SHCIL). At the end of the December quarter, SHCIL owned 4.4% in NSE. In the unlisted market, NSE shares are trading around Rs 2,100 per share. Going by that, SHCIL's stake in NSE is worth around Rs 23,000 crore. IFCI owns 52% stake in SHCIL.NSE IPO coming soon?Last week, Sebi chief had said that it is in a very advanced stage of issuing the NOC (no-objection certificate) for NSE IPO, and that could happen as soon as this month itself. At another event on Thursday, he said Sebi has agreed in principle to NSE's settlement application in the long-running unfair market access case.He also said the government has approved a 2.5% stake dilution in the exchange and that a notification in this regard will be issued soon. The development is being seen as the strongest signal yet that the country's largest stock exchange may finally move closer to an IPO.The NSE has been seeking regulatory approval for its IPO for several years, following governance lapses and the co-location controversy that had come under SEBI’s scrutiny. The exchange had first filed its draft red herring prospectus (DRHP) in December 2016, but the process was delayed amid regulatory action related to allegations of preferential access to its algorithmic trading platform.Live EventsIn August 2024, NSE reapplied to SEBI for a fresh no-objection certificate to proceed with its public issue. Subsequently, in October 2024, the exchange settled the Trading Access Point (TAP) architecture and network connectivity case by paying a penalty of ₹643 crore. The case pertained to alleged deficiencies in d",2026-01-22,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/nse-ipo-proxy-play-why-smallcap-ifci-shares-jumped-26-in-just-1-week/articleshow/126560420.cms,neutral,economictimes,,,,1

"Jio valuation may jump to $190 billion by 2028, says CLSA, raises RIL target price to Rs 1,800","Jio Platforms’ enterprise valuation (EV) could climb to about $190 billion by March 2028, with CLSA arguing that the planned listing of theRelianceunit could create one of the world’s top 10 telecom stocks and drive upside in Reliance Industries’ share price. The brokerage has raised its 12‑month target price onReliance Industriesto Rs 1,800 from Rs 1,650 while reiterating an “Outperform” rating, even after trimming valuation multiples for the group’s retail and new energy businesses.CLSA forecasts Jio’s enterprise value at $161 billion by March 2027, rising to $190 billion a year later, assigning the business a 15% valuation premium to the average free‑cash‑flow yield of global telecom peers excluding China.“Using a 12‑month forward FCF yield of 4.6%, our Jio base case is for Mar 2027/Mar 2028CL EVs of US$161bn/US$190bn,” the brokerage said, adding that Jio’s IPO “could position it amongst world’s most valuable telecom players.”Reliance is targeting a Jio listing by mid‑2026, which CLSA calls “the key event” for the conglomerate this year.The note argues that free‑cash‑flow yield, rather than Ebitda or reported Arpu, is the most appropriate yardstick to benchmark Jio against global telcos, citing divergent accounting for spectrum and licences as well as Reliance’s strategy of front‑loading capex and capitalising opex. On its forecasts, Jio’s free cash flow is expected to jump from $1.7 billion in FY25 to $7.4 billion in FY28 and $8.7 billion in FY29 as 5G investment tapers off and cash generation accelerates. “With most 5G capex front‑loaded, Jio is expected [to] achieve significant free cash flow over the coming years,” CLSA said.Live EventsThe brokerage justifies the premium multiple by flagging four growth levers: monetisation of Jio’s in‑house 5G stack and UBR technology by partnering with other operators, a large under‑penetrated broadband opportunity, scope to lift Arpu by upgrading users to 5G, and the ability to monetise one of the highest customer‑engageme",2026-01-22,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/jio-valuation-may-jump-to-190-billion-by-2028-says-clsa-raises-ril-target-price-to-rs-1800/articleshow/126973813.cms,neutral,economictimes,,,,1

China examines foreign ETF trades after Jane Street India probe,"China is scrutinizing howJane Street Groupand otherforeign firmsparticipate in its $859 billion exchange-traded fund market, seeking information on such activities carried out by brokers, according to people with knowledge of the matter.Chinese regulators are keen to understand trading patterns in the fast-growing industry, especially after a crackdown onJane Streetin India, said the people, asking not to be identified discussing a private matter. Indian regulators last year accused Jane Street of misleading retail investors through alleged index manipulation — claims the New York-based firm has denied.Jane Street was the biggest foreign ETF market maker through the country’s qualified foreign investor program as of June 30, followed by the Amsterdam-based Optiver and US firms Susquehanna International Group and Hudson River Trading, according to Bloomberg Intelligence. Jane Street accounts for less than 2% of overall ETF trading in mainland China, according to a person briefed on the matter.China’s queries led UBS Group AG to pause some trades from Jane Street via the QFI program late last year, the people said. UBS accounted for a relatively small portion of Jane Street’s China ETF transactions before the pause, according to one person. Barclays, another top broker for foreign ETF market makers, declined to comment when asked about its trading relationship with Jane Street in China.Jane Street said in an emailed statement that the firm “is conducting business as usual with its counterparties globally, including UBS, across asset classes.” Representatives for Susquehanna, Hudson River and UBS declined to comment. Representatives for the China Securities Regulatory Commission and Optiver didn’t respond to requests for comment.Live EventsBloombergUBS’s move was a precautionary measure that didn’t impact Jane Street’s other strategies for China, the people said. No firm is accused of any wrongdoing. There’s no indication that trading relationships among Jane Street’s",2026-01-22,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/china-examines-foreign-etf-trades-after-jane-street-india-probe/articleshow/126495827.cms,neutral,economictimes,,,,1

Retail algo trading is no longer a shortcut. It is becoming the new standard in India’s F&O markets,"Not long ago, algorithmic trading in India was something most retail traders admired from a distance. It was fast, complex, and mostly used by institutions or high-frequency desks. But all of that is changing, and quickly.Thanks to SEBI’s 2025 framework, retail algo trading has moved from grey areas and technical hacks to a regulated, structured space. What was once a luxury for the few is now becoming the foundation for many, especially in India’s futures and options (F&O) markets.From Unregulated Tools to a Safe, Structured SystemEarlier, many retail traders turned to third-party apps, self-made scripts, or informal tools to automate their trades. These setups worked, but often without any broker oversight, risk checks, or transparency. It was fast, but also risky.SEBI has now stepped in with a clear rulebook. Under the new guidelines:All strategies must be approved by the exchangeEach strategy is tagged with a unique ID to track every orderBrokers must host and monitor all strategies on their own systemsRisk controls like position limits and kill switches are built in, not optionalEvery strategy must be tested in a live-like environment before going liveIn short, retail traders can still use automation, but now it happens inside a safe and visible system, with real checks in place.Live EventsWhat These Strategies Look Like NowYou no longer need to write complex code or hire a developer. Most retail algo platforms now offer a menu of pre-built strategies. You pick one, set your capital and risk preferences, and the system does the rest.Some popular strategy types include:Momentum strategies that jump into trades during strong price movesTrend-following models that ride longer market trends with automated exitsOptions algos like straddles or strangles that trade around volatilityEach one is tested, approved, and comes with defined rules. You are not betting on guesswork. You are following a system.Why This Matters in F&O TradingF&O trading is fast.

Are technical indicators flagging deeper weakness across Nifty 500 stocks?,"Mumbai:Technical momentum indicatorsafter the recent stock market selloff are pointing to a weakening undertone in the country's top 500 shares. The majority of the stocks on the Nifty 500 index are trading below their short- and long-term moving averages, according to ICICI Securities, signalling broad-based weakness.Out of the 500 shares, 70% are trading below the 50 day moving average (DMA) while 60% are below their 200 DMA, the data said.When an index or a stock is below 50 DMA, it reflects a loss of short- to medium-term momentum and vice versa. It represents the average closing price of a stock over the past 50 trading days. Similarly, a stock or index below the 200 SMA signals a weakening long-term trend.The decline in the majority of the stocks is below both the 50- and 200-DMAs, showing short-term momentum has faded, and the longer-term trend is under pressure, suggesting sellers might be dominating across sectors.Earlier this month, when the Nifty hit all-time highs, 54% of the stocks in the Nifty 500 universe were trading above both the 50- and 200-DMAs.Live Events""Over the past week, broader selling pressure has weakened the market breadth further,"" said Dharmesh Shah, head of technicals at ICICI Securities.Equities have been weighed down of late by intensifying concerns over the delay in a trade pact between the US and India. Donald Trump's support for a Bill that advocates a 500% tariff on imports from countries such as India and China that purchase Russian oil spooked investors last week, though the uncertainty eased after US ambassador to India, Sergio Gor, said India and the US will discuss trade issues soon.AgenciesMOST OF NIFTY 500 TRADING BELOW KEY AVERAGES: Short-term momentum fades and longer term trend’s under pressure amid broader selling; stocks nearing oversold territoryMarket breadthNifty is down nearly 2% since its new all-time highs made on January 5 and has declined 2.5% in the past week.

NBFCs set for strongest earnings in nine quarters. 10 stock picks from Motilal Oswal ahead of Q3 results,"NBFC-lending companies are expected to deliver around 26% YoY PAT growth in Q3FY26, the strongest performance in nine quarters, driven by steady AUM growth, improving margins and controlled credit costs. Motilal Oswal expects NII and PPoP to grow around 16–17% YoY, with vehicle financiers, housing finance companies, and select retail lenders leading the cycle. Motilal expects NII growth of nearly 24% YoY and PAT growth of 20% YoY, supported by diversified lending, strong vehicle finance demand and stable asset quality. CreditAccess is projected to post a sharp turnaround with 107% sequential profit growth, driven by improving collection efficiency, lower credit costs and stabilisation in the microfinance portfolio. Motilal expects double-digit YoY growth in NII and operating profit, though PAT growth remains muted due to higher operating expenses. Fusion Finance is expected to see 47% operating profit growth YoY, aided by margin expansion and cost control, even as NII growth remains moderate. Home First stands out with over 35% YoY NII growth and more than 45% YoY PAT growth, driven by rapid AUM expansion in affordable housing and strong operating leverage. Sequential growth trends also remain robust. Motilal expects strong YoY growth across NII (24%), operating profit (88%) and PAT (989%), supported by improving asset quality and operating efficiencies. L&T Finance is projected to deliver double-digit YoY growth in NII and PAT, backed by retail-focused portfolio expansion and improving cost metrics. Sequential performance remains stable, supporting earnings visibility. Motilal expects healthy YoY NII growth, supported by vehicle finance demand, though profit growth remains uneven due to credit cost pressures. Strong QoQ improvement in PAT suggests stabilisation trends. Shriram Finance is expected to post nearly 17% YoY NII growth and over 23% YoY PAT growth, driven by robust AUM expansion in commercial vehicle financing and operating leverage.

"Gold vs stocks, Nifty targets and 10 other market myths debunked by DSP Mutual Fund","Two of the biggest questions dominating investors’ minds now are whether gold will continue to outperform stocks and what the target for the Nifty is in 2026. DSP Mutual Fund has addressed these and 10 other topics in its latest NETRA report, taking direct aim at some of the market’s most persistent beliefs and arguing that investors anchor too heavily to myths about gold, GDP, flows, smallcaps, SIP timing and index targets instead of hard data.Here are 12 such myths:1) Gold is dead money and can’t beat equitiesThe widely held view that gold is a useless “pet rock” that always trails equities is belied by 21st-century data, where bullion has actually outperformed every major stock market in local currency terms, including India and the US. In India, only about a quarter of NSE 500 stocks have beaten gold on a market-cap-weighted basis over this period, making a zero-gold allocation look more like a bias than a rational decision.2) Gold has replaced equities as the only asset worth owningThe reverse belief, that gold is now the only game in town, also fails the data test, as five-year rolling returns show equities beating gold around half the time in India and the US, and more often in Europe and Hong Kong. There have been long stretches when staying invested in diversified indices would have delivered better outcomes than holding just gold, reinforcing that bullion is a useful diversifier, not a one-way ticket to wealth.Live Events3) Diversification dilutes returns and is “di-worse-ification”The claim that spreading money across assets drags down performance is challenged by DSP’s back-tests showing a 50–20–15–15 mix of domestic equity, debt, international equity and gold delivering equity-like returns with much lower volatility across markets. Outside the US, this diversified basket has even beaten pure local equities in nominal terms over 20-year horizons, with significantly lower standard deviation in countries like India and China.4) High GDP growth automaticall",2026-01-22,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/gold-vs-stocks-nifty-targets-and-10-other-market-myths-debunked-by-dsp-mutual-fund/articleshow/126368503.cms,neutral,economictimes,,,,1

"ONGC, Oil India and other oil-linked stocks in focus as crude slides after Iran tensions ease","ONGC,Oil India,Reliance Industries,Indian Oil Corporation,BPCLandHPCLare set to dominate investor attention on Friday after global crude prices posted their sharpest single-day fall in weeks, reshaping the near-term outlook for upstream producers, refiners and a wide swathe of oil-sensitive sectors from paints and aviation to tyres.The roughly 4% drop in oil on Thursday snapped a five-day rally driven by geopolitical fears, reviving the investment case for select oil-linked stocks even as questions linger over how long the pullback will last.Oil prices retreated after U.S. President Donald Trump said the crackdown on protesters in Iran was easing, tempering fears of imminent military action and potential supply disruptions from the Middle East. Brent crude futures settled down $2.76, or 4.15%, at $63.76 a barrel on Thursday, while U.S. West Texas Intermediate fell $2.83, or 4.56%, to $59.19 a barrel.Prices steadied early Friday. Brent was down 3 cents, or 0.05%, at $63.73 per barrel, while WTI was up 4 cents, or 0.07%, at $59.22 per barrel as of 0223 GMT, after both benchmarks had climbed to multi-month highs earlier in the week amid unrest in Iran and signals from Trump that strikes were possible.Stocks and sectors in playLive EventsThe move in crude is likely to ripple across Indian equities. Upstream companies such as ONGC and Oil India typically track oil prices closely, while refiners including Indian Oil, BPCL and HPCL tend to benefit from softer crude through improved margins. Reliance Industries, with its integrated oil-to-chemicals business, also remains in focus, alongside oil-sensitive sectors such as paints, aviation and tyres.Brokerage Choice Institutional Equities said Brent prices fell over 4% on Jan. 15 after an 11% rally the previous week, during which “geopolitical risk premiums climbed as concerns shifted from oversupply to structural supply threats, driven by unrest in Iran, repeated Black Sea tanker attacks, and heightened prospects of U.S. mili",2026-01-22,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/ongc-oil-india-and-other-oil-linked-stocks-in-focus-as-crude-slides-after-iran-tensions-ease/articleshow/126556750.cms,neutral,economictimes,,,,1

"Bears tighten grip on Nifty. Can it break above 26,100 to signal a turnaround?","TheNiftyenters the new week on a weak footing after breaking key trend supports and short term moving averages, signalling a bearish bias. Persistent selling on intraday recoveries and rise in volatility suggest downside risks toward the 25,300–25,350 zone, while sentiment is unlikely to stabilise unless the index decisively moves back above the 25,900–26,100 resistance band.SOMIL MEHTAHEAD OF ALTERNATE RESEARCH, MIRAE ASSET SHAREKHANWhere is Nifty headed?The Nifty has broken below its ascending trendline and closed under the key 20-day moving average (DMA) of 26,062 and the 40-DMA at 25,970, confirming short-term weakness. Momentum indicators have flashed a negative crossover. The index could drift toward 25,300, with a “sell on rise” strategy advisable until a decisive break above the 26,100 resistance. A put-call ratio of 0.51 signals bearish sentiment, while volatility is likely to persist.Trading strategiesNifty (Positional): Sell on a bounce toward 26,000 for targets of 25,800 and 25,300, with a stop loss at 26,200.

More pain ahead? Top 10 retail-dominated stocks crash up to 43% as Indian markets underperformed since one year,"Several stocks dominated by retail ownership have delivered negative returns since June 2024, even after strong gains in the earlier rally. According to Kotak Equities, the correction has been sharper in names where the gap between retail and institutional ownership is wide, highlighting how crowded retail trades can unwind quickly when market momentum fades. Reliance Infrastructure, with retail ownership of about 45%, has slipped 13% since June 2024 after a strong run earlier. Olectra Greentech corrected sharply by 34% after delivering outsized gains in the previous phase. High retail participation amplified volatility as valuations cooled in the green mobility space. Valor Estate gave back a portion of its earlier rally, falling 27% in the recent period. Tata Technologies saw negative returns of 36% after listing-era enthusiasm waned. Kotak Equities data shows retail-heavy positioning made the stock vulnerable once growth expectations moderated. Ircon International erased nearly half of its earlier gains, slipping into the red since June 2024. The correction came despite strong past performance in rail and infrastructure themes. Latent View Analytics delivered negative returns of 4% as sentiment around midcap IT and analytics stocks weakened. Retail dominance limited downside support during the correction. Tata Teleservices declined 36% in the recent period after modest gains earlier. High retail ownership contributed to sharper drawdowns as trading interest cooled. IREDA corrected 30% since June 2024 after a strong run linked to the renewable energy theme. The stock's recent negative returns highlight valuation fatigue in PSU green energy plays. Happiest Minds slipped 41% as IT stocks faced pressure from slowing demand signals. Retail-heavy ownership coincided with sustained selling pressure. Alok Industries saw negative returns of 43% despite earlier optimism around turnaround hopes. The stock struggled as fundamentals failed to keep pace with expectations.

Shadowfax IPO in focus: GMP and 10 key takeaways for investors ahead of subscription,"Shadowfax Technologies is set to hit the primary market with an IPO of Rs 1,907 crore. Ahead of the issue opening, the stock is trading at a grey market premium of around 13%, indicating optimistic listing expectations. Shadowfax Technologies is set to launch its Rs 1,907 crore IPO. The issue will open for subscription on January 20 and close on January 22, while the shares are scheduled to list on the BSE and NSE on January 28. The IPO price band is fixed at Rs 118 to Rs 124 per share. Retail investors can apply for a minimum of 120 shares, translating to an investment of Rs 14,880 at the upper end of the band. The public issue comprises a fresh issue of shares worth Rs 1,000 crore and an offer for sale of Rs 907 crore by existing shareholders. In the greymarket, Shadowfax shares are trading at a premium of around 13% over the issue price. This indicates expectations of a positive listing, though GMP is not a guarantee of performance and can change quickly. At the upper end of the price band, Shadowfax is valued at approximately Rs 7,168 crore. Investors are likely to assess this valuation in light of the company’s recent return to profitability, growth prospects, and long-term scalability. Shadowfax operates an asset-light logistics model focused on e-commerce express parcels, hyperlocal and quick commerce deliveries. It caters to both large platforms and D2C brands, enabling fast, tech-driven last-mile delivery. As of September 2025, the company operated across 14,758 pin codes with over 4,299 touchpoints and a daily fleet of more than 3,000 trucks. Its large gig-based delivery partner network is a key competitive advantage. Shadowfax has shown a turnaround in profitability. For the first half of FY26, it reported a profit after tax of Rs 21 crore compared with losses in earlier years, while EBITDA margins have steadily improved. Funds from the fresh issue will be used to expand network infrastructure, fund lease payments for new centres, invest in branding and m",2026-01-22,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/shadowfax-ipo-in-focus-gmp-and-10-key-takeaways-for-investors-ahead-of-subscription/slideshow/126537896.cms,neutral,economictimes,,,,1

Bharat Coking Coal shares rally 4% on Day 2. Should you buy?,"Shares ofBharat Coking CoalLtd (BCCL) rose 4.24% to Rs 42.29 on Tuesday, extending gains from their blockbuster market debut a day earlier. The stock had listed on Monday at a 97% premium to its issue price and ended the session with 77% gains, making it the best-performing IPO on listing day since December 2024 and the first mainboard IPO of the new year.The Rs 1,071-crore IPO witnessed one of the strongest subscription responses in recent years, drawing bids worth over Rs 1.1 lakh crore. Exchange data showed demand for 50.93 billion shares at the upper end of the price band of Rs 23, translating into bids of around Rs 1.17 lakh crore, highlighting strong investor appetite.What should investors do now?Shivani Nyati, Head of Wealth atSwastika Investmart, advised traders and short-term investors to consider booking profits, while long-term investors may continue to hold the stock with a stop-loss of Rs 35, keeping a medium-to-long-term perspective. “The stellar listing was driven by strong fundamentals, BCCL’s strategic role in India’s steel and metallurgical coal supply chain, and a positive outlook for the coal and core infrastructure sectors. Heavy IPO oversubscription across categories translated into aggressive buying on debut,” she said.Rajan Shinde, Research Analyst at Mehta Equities, said BCCL offers exposure to a strategically critical asset with a dominant position in India’s coking coal value chain. He cited the company’s large reserve base in the Jharia coalfields, leadership in coking coal washery capacity, and strong logistics infrastructure as key competitive advantages. “Backed byCoal India’s technical and financial strength, BCCL is well placed to benefit from structural demand tailwinds and India’s import substitution push. With washery expansion, asset monetisation and normalisation of mining activity, we expect a recovery in volumes and earnings from FY2027, supporting long-term value creation,” Shinde said.Live EventsGaurav Garg, Research Analyst",2026-01-22,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/bharat-coking-coal-shares-rally-4-on-day-2-should-you-buy/articleshow/126762650.cms,neutral,economictimes,,,,1
"Trump tariffs, Q3 earnings among 8 factors to impact D-Street this week","Markets witnesed a sharp sell‑off last week, with benchmark indices ending firmly in the red as weak global cues and elevated uncertainty weighed on sentiment. Selling pressure intensified towards the close, dragging theSensexdown 2.55% to 83,576.24 and theNiftylower by 2.45% to 25,683.30—one of the steepest weekly drops in recent months. Broader markets lagged the frontline indices, reflecting a distinct risk‑off trend.Global developments dominated the market mood. Fresh concerns over sharply higher US tariffs on Indian exports and lingering uncertainty around India–US trade relations triggered risk aversion. Geopolitical tensions involving the US and Venezuela further dampened confidence, while sustained selling by foreign institutional investors kept FIIs net sellers in equities throughout the week.Here are the factors that could shape market direction in the upcoming week:1.Q3 earnings: The coming week marks the start of the earnings season, with giants likeTCS,Infosys,Wipro,Reliance Industries,HDFC BankandICICI Bank, among others, reporting their results for the third quarter of FY26.2.Macroeconomic calendar: The Street is set to witness a busy macroeconomic calendar. Investors will closely track India’s CPI inflation, WPI inflation, trade balance, and foreign exchange reserves data for cues on inflation trends and external stability.Live Events3.Trump tariffs: Globally, markets will keenly watch developments around the US Supreme Court verdict on the legality of Trump-era tariffs, which could act as a key sentiment driver.4.Geopolitical developments: Ongoing geopolitical developments will also remain on investors’ radar.5.FII activity: On Friday, foreign institutional investors (FIIs) recorded net sales of Rs 3,609 crore in the Indian equities, while domestic institutional investors (DIIs) were net buyers at Rs 5,341.01 crore.6.Currency movements: Rupee weakened, pressured by weakness in domestic equity markets and continued FII selling.

"Bernstein picks Eternal’s Blinkit to outpace Swiggy, Zepto in 2026 but says ‘brace for volatility’","International brokerage firmBernsteinexpectsEternal’s quick commerce armBlinkitto continue outpacing rivalsSwiggy, Instamart, andZeptoin 2026, even as intensifying competition keeps profitability volatile and stock returns are likely to be uneven throughout the year.Bernstein says Eternal is its preferred pick in the sector, citing Blinkit’s stronger operating metrics, lower cash burn, and more established contribution margins. The brokerage has a target price of Rs 370, implying an upside of 31% from current market levels.According to Bernstein, Blinkit has the ability to retain its leadership position and believes that the current price offers a more favorable risk-reward proposition given its established positive contribution margin, better operating metrics across the board and a much lower cash burn. The brokerage believes most of the competitive pressure and resulting impact is already priced in the stock.For Swiggy, over the longer term, Bernstein remains positive on its ability to deploy expanded cash cushion to scale its dark store network, improve operating metrics and strengthen unit economics. Bernstein maintains its Outperform rating and forecasts 42% upside (Rs 500 target price) from current levels.Here’s what the brokerage says about the ever-evolving space.Swiggy, Zepto follow closeIn 2025, the performance gap between leaders (Blinkit, Instamart, Zepto) and challengers Flipkart, Amazon, BigBasket, and JioMart grew materially. But 2206 will be different, says Berstein, adding that collective focus by leaders on core customer cohorts to ‘lock-in’ unit economics and efforts by challengers to establish a foothold before it is ‘too late’, would heat the battle. As a result, analysts suggest aggressive discounting in the first half of 2026 and store expansion all across.Live EventsQC in 2026Quick commerce growth is expected to remain strong, with the industry projected to expand by around 80% in 2026, driven by continued dark store additions, deeper discou",2026-01-22,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/bernstein-picks-eternals-blinkit-to-outpace-swiggy-zepto-in-2026-but-says-brace-for-volatility/articleshow/126433184.cms,neutral,economictimes,,,,1

"SRF, Welspun Living among 12 midcap picks by Systematix Research with upside potential of up to 53%","Brokerage firm Systematix Research anticipates healthy year-on-year momentum across the Indian speciality chemicals sector during Q3FY26, supported by volume-led growth and the commercialisation of strategic capex projects. While pricing in some segments may remain range-bound, companies like SRF are expected to benefit from a seasonal uptick in refrigerant and speciality chemical volumes.However, blended margins may still face pressure due to weakness in technical textiles. Based on its comprehensive sector view, Systematix has released its updated ratings and target prices for a range of midcap names across speciality chemicals, textiles, and diversified industries.

The brokerage sees potential in Deepak Nitrite, rating it as ‘HOLD’ with a price target of Rs 1,779 and an upside potential of 13.75%. A target of Rs 6,199 has been set for Navin Fluorine, which comes with a ‘HOLD’ rating and implies an upside of 2.8%. SRF is rated ‘HOLD’ by the brokerage, which values the stock at a target of Rs 3,295, indicating an upside potential of 8.75%. Vinati Organics is expected to rise to Rs 1,599 as per Systematix’s target, though the stock holds a ‘HOLD’ rating, suggesting an upside of 0.35%. Systematix has kept a ‘HOLD’ stance on KPR Mill, estimating a fair value of Rs 1,030 with an upside potential of 20%. Gokaldas Exports has been rated ‘HOLD’, with a target price pegged at Rs 914, pointing to an upside of 52.7%.

IEX shares fall 6% as APTEL begins hearing on market coupling case,"Shares ofIndian Energy Exchange(IEX) declined 5.8% to Rs 141.40 on the BSE on Wednesday as the Appellate Tribunal for Electricity (APTEL) began hearing the case against theCentral Electricity Regulatory Commission’s (CERC) market coupling directions.During the proceedings, the APTEL bench stated that it wants to ensure CERC has functioned in a fair manner and has acted independently in its decision-making.The bench also noted that it would be incorrect to assume that the 2025 ruling, norms, or orders will automatically continue, indicating that the previous directive may not be upheld.The ongoing hearing marks a critical development in the long-standing regulatory debate surrounding market coupling, with implications for IEX’s role in price discovery and overall market structure.Ahead of the hearing, the Central Electricity Regulatory Commission (CERC) had issued a fresh clarification on its July 2025 market coupling order.Live EventsIn its latest statement, CERC said the order should be read as “directions,” a move that appears to have heightened investor caution ahead of the scheduled hearing by the Appellate Tribunal for Electricity (APTEL).The clarification came just before the round of proceedings in the market coupling case, where APTEL was set to hear petitions challenging the formulation process of the July order.The hearing was earlier postponed after the CERC told the tribunal it was willing to take directions regarding the withdrawal of its contentious July 23, 2025, order that had sparked strong reactions in the market.The original order had introduced a market coupling mechanism, a structural reform that could potentially alter how electricity prices are discovered across power exchanges. Following the announcement in July 2025,IEX shareshad plunged sharply in a single session, as the move was seen as diluting the company’s dominance in price discovery, liquidity, and trading volumes.Currently, IEX holds a commanding 85% market share in thespot power ma",2026-01-22,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/iex-shares-in-focus-ahead-of-aptel-hearing-on-market-coupling-case/articleshow/126426054.cms,neutral,economictimes,,,,1

"Asian stocks, US treasuries fall on tariff angst","Asian shares slipped at the open Tuesday as President Donald Trump’stariff threatsover Greenland revived trade tensions and weighed on investor appetite for risk.Stocks edged lower in Australia and Japan. On Monday, European shares fell the most since November, while the US was shut for a public holiday. Contracts for the S&P 500 fell 0.9%. Treasuries declined at the open with the yield on the benchmark 10-year bond gaining three basis points to 4.26%. Gold and silver were a touch lower after closing at record highs.The yen was steady in early trading Tuesday after Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi officially called an early election next month. Investors are on tenterhooks ahead of an auction of 20-year Japanese sovereign bonds Tuesday.Trump’s threat to tariff countries opposing his bid to control Greenland has reignited themarket volatilityseen early in his second term. European resistance and talk of retaliation deepened the selloff, while investors have sought refuge in precious metals amid rising tensions and renewed attacks on the Federal Reserve’s independence.“The nervousness is palpable,” said Alexandre Baradez, chief market analyst at IG in Paris. “All in all, you have so many issues piling up — from credit cards to the independence of the Fed and tariffs — that I really don’t see the case for stock markets to keep on breaching new records.”Live EventsThe standoff comes as resilient earnings and ongoing investment in artificial intelligence have underpinned risk appetite. Market direction now partly depends on the European Union’s response, with the bloc considering tariffs on €93 billion ($108 billion) worth of US goods.French President Emmanuel Macron intended to request the activation of the EU’s so-called anti-coercion instrument, Bloomberg reported over the weekend.

HDFC Bank shares fall 4% in 4 sessions. Will Q3 results change the script?,"Shares of India’s largest private-sector lender,HDFC Bank, declined as much as 1% to an intraday low of Rs 942 on Thursday, January 8, extending their losing streak to a fourth straight session. The stock has shed nearly 4% over this period, ahead of the bank’s third-quarter earnings announcement scheduled for January 17.What’s in store for investors? December quarter performance points to steady balance-sheet expansion, with brokerages flagging a mixed near-term outlook on margins amid moderating yields, even as asset quality and cost discipline remain supportive.Management has indicated that most of the asset-side repricing is now behind, and NIMs are expected to benefit from the downward repricing of term deposits, with rate cuts already reflected in savings account rates.Axis Securities says HDFC Bank has remained largely on track with its guidance as it works towards reverting to pre-merger levels across key metrics, underpinned by strong execution capabilities. The brokerage has assigned a target price of Rs 1,170 per share, an upside of 23% from current levels. With the loan-to-deposit ratio (LDR) now below 100%, the bank is likely to accelerate growth in FY26 to align with system-wide trends. A further pickup in growth in FY27E, alongside sustained deposit mobilisation, should help bring the LDR down to sub-90%. Margin pressure seen in H1 is expected to ease in H2, supported by deposit repricing and the impact of CRR cuts on exit margins.InCred Equities, with a price target of Rs 1,180 per share, says margins are expected to trough at levels better than earlier anticipated, and, together with benign asset quality trends and sustained deposit growth momentum, this should support a rerating of the stock in the coming months.Live EventsThe Street is likely to closely track the extent of PSL compliance through organic growth as well as the bank’s borrowing repayment schedule. The brokerage maintains an ADD rating on HDFC Bank with a target price of Rs 1,180, imp",2026-01-22,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/hdfc-bank-shares-fall-4-in-4-sessions-will-q3-results-change-the-script/articleshow/126407511.cms,neutral,economictimes,,,,1
European stocks close at record as Glencore jumps on Rio Tinto interest,"European shares ended Friday at a record high, powered by a surge ⁠inGlencorethat helped put theSTOXX 600on its longest weekly winning streak since May.After two straight losing sessions, the rebound underscored investors' resilience, even as a run of weak earnings and renewed geopolitical tensions, sparked by U.S. ‌actions in Venezuela, ‌weighed on sentiment.

"FIIs dump Rs 22,530 crore worth of domestic shares in first fortnight of January","Foreign institutional investors(FIIs) sold domestic equities worth Rs 22,530 crore in the first fortnight of January, extending their selling streak. The pace of outflows accelerated in the holiday-shortened week, with foreign investors offloading Rs 14,266 crore worth of shares in just four sessions.FIIs remained net sellers, extending their recent selling trends as tariff-related uncertainties and geopolitical tensions offset the optimism from better-than-expectedQ3 earningsby select large-cap IT companies, said Ajit Mishra, Senior Vice President, Research atReligareBroking.Given the mixed domestic and global backdrop and persistent foreign fund outflows, it is essential to manage leverage and position sizes prudently, he recommended.The FIIs were net sellers in December, offloading domestic shares worth Rs 22,611 crore during the month while taking total outflows in 2025 to Rs 1,66,286 crore.FIIs sold shares worth Rs 11,766 crore in Q3 after offloading shares worth Rs 76,619 crore in the third quarter of CY25. They reversed the buying trends seen in the April–June period when inflows totalled Rs 38,673 crore. The year had opened on a sharply negative note, with foreign investors pulling out a massive Rs 1,16,574 crore during the January–March quarter.Live EventsMarket expert V K Vijayakumar blames the relatively elevated valuations in India and the AI trade as major factors behind the FII exodus in the year gone by. Their sustained selling has also contributed towards a significant drop in Indian rupee against the US dollar, the Chief Investment Strategist at Geojit Investments said.On Nifty's likely moves, next week, Mishra of Religare said that a decisive break from the prevailing consolidation range would offer cues for the next directional move. He said that market participants should focus on quality large-cap and larger midcap stocks, particularly in sectors with stronger earnings visibility and institutional interest.

"After asset quality hit, small finance banks to sharpen risk controls for 2026","Kolkata:Small finance banks, which were the worst hit by themicrofinance crisisin terms ofasset qualitystress, are looking to deepen their risk-first reset in 2026 and bring down the share of the unsecured business further. They are also planning to grow the share of loans undercredit guarantee coverto prevent fresh erosion of asset quality.This strategy remains similar for all small finance banks with large microfinance exposure, especially for ESAF, Suryoday, Ujjivan and Utkarsh, which have a high share of unsecured portfolio.Growth incollateralised lendingto small businesses, and offering vehicle loans, affordable housing loans and gold loans to their customer segment remains the priority.The Reserve Bank of India's move to reduce the priority sector lending target for SFBs to 60% of adjusted net bank credit from 75% earlier has set an easier platform for these lenders to diversify beyond microfinance.Ujjivan's 52% portfolio was unsecured at the end of December 2025, while the share of unsecured books was 45% for Suryoday and about 37% for ESAF. Utkarsh, the bank with the highest bad loan ratio at 12.4% among its peers at the end of September, had 53% of the book unsecured while the latest number after the end of third quarter was unavailable.Live EventsThe small finance bank group as a whole saw about 22% of their unsecured microfinance portfolio turn bad as of March last year, when the sectoral NPA including write-off accounts was around 16%.As part of the risk-first strategy, ESAF is eyeing to bring down the share ofunsecured loansto 30% of its total portfolio by March 2027. ""We continue to focus on gold loan, mortgage, mobility loans,"" a senior executive said.Suryoday aims to bring down the unsecured share to 35-40% by FY27.Ujjivan would take a longer time to reduce the unsecured share. According to a five-year business strategy adopted last year, the bank plans to reduce it to 30-35% by FY30 while the balance would be a secured portfolio.For Utkarsh, the tar",2026-01-22,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/after-asset-quality-hit-small-finance-banks-to-sharpen-risk-controls-for-2026/articleshow/126473364.cms,neutral,economictimes,,,,1

"Motilal Oswal initiates coverage on Canara HSBC Life, sets Rs 180 target; lists 5 growth drivers","Domestic brokerage firm Motilal Oswal has initiated coverage onCanara HSBC LifeInsurance with a Buy rating and a target price of Rs 180, citing a confluence of long-term structural tailwinds and company-specific drivers that could support consistent growth and margin expansion over the coming years.The brokerage sees the company benefiting from favourable macro trends in the life insurance industry, robust bancassurance partnerships, channel diversification and improving operational metrics.According to Motilal, the life insurance industry in India remains significantly underpenetrated, providing fertile ground for long-term growth. With private players steadily increasing market share and regulatory tailwinds aiding capital efficiency and product expansion, Canara HSBC Life is well positioned to deliver a 16% to 18% APE CAGR over the medium term.1. Industry underpenetration and regulatory supportIndia’s life insurance sector remains structurally underpenetrated, with premium-to-GDP ratios significantly lower than peers in Asia. At 2.8% and 85%, India lags behind Singapore at 7.4% and 332%, Thailand at 3.4% and 143%, and Malaysia at 3.7% and 153%. The protection gap in India is also substantial at 83%.APE growthhas remained strong at 12% over the past decade. Motilal expects this underpenetration, combined with regulatory reforms such as risk-based solvency and the introduction of a composite licence regime, to unlock new growth levers for life insurers. The brokerage expects 16% to 18% APE CAGR for the sector over the medium term.Live Events2. Canara Bank offers strong distribution backboneMotilal highlightsCanara Bankas the key growth pillar for Canara HSBC Life. The analytics-driven model, enhanced customer segmentation and TAT-monitored lead flows are aiding premium growth. The firm notes that productivity at Canara branches was just Rs 1.6 million per branch in FY25, significantly below SBI’s Rs 6.8 million. Even a partial catch-up could unlock material growth,",2026-01-22,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/motilal-oswal-initiates-coverage-on-canara-hsbc-life-sets-rs-180-target-lists-5-growth-drivers/articleshow/126517934.cms,neutral,economictimes,,,,1

"Swiggy, Infosys among 17 stocks in BNP Paribas' top buy ideas for 2026. Check list here","BNP Paribas expects 2026 to be a stronger year for Indian equities, with the Nifty 50 seen delivering mid-teens returns and a December 2026 target of 29,500, driven largely by earnings growth rather than valuation re-rating. The brokerage is more constructive on large caps and domestic-oriented sectors such as banks, autos, telecom and consumer staples, citing policy support, improving earnings visibility and resilient domestic flows. Here are the brokerage's top buy ideas for 2026: BNP Paribas lists Maruti Suzuki and Mahindra & Mahindra among its top buy ideas, citing a favourable outlook for passenger vehicle makers following GST cuts that have lowered on-road prices and boosted volumes. The brokerage expects operating leverage and lower discounting to support margin expansion through FY27. It has set a target price of Rs 19,130 for Maruti Suzuki and Rs 4,120 for Mahindra & Mahindra. Infosys is BNP Paribas’ preferred large-cap IT services pick, with the brokerage viewing the current slowdown as cyclical and expecting a recovery from March 2026 as global macro conditions stabilise. BNP Paribas has a target price of Rs 1,900 on Infosys. BNP Paribas has turned positive on consumer staples and internet-linked consumption plays, naming Britannia Industries and Swiggy as top ideas. For Britannia, it expects a recovery in volumes and margins aided by GST cuts, a favourable earnings base and improving consumption trends. Swiggy features as a preferred discretionary and internet play, with BNP Paribas setting target prices of Rs 6,950 for Britannia and Rs 500 for Swiggy. The brokerage remains constructive on private sector banks and life insurance, citing improving credit growth, supportive liquidity conditions and balance sheet strength. It expects a strong earnings rebound for banks in FY27 and continued momentum in insurance driven by ULIP demand and favourable yield dynamics. BNP Paribas’ target prices are Rs 1,460 for HDFC Bank, Rs 1,990 for ICICI Bank, Rs 1,660 for A",2026-01-22,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/swiggy-infosys-among-17-stocks-in-bnp-paribas-top-buy-ideas-for-2026-check-list-here/slideshow/126447880.cms,neutral,economictimes,,,,1

"Tech Mahindra shares rally 4% after Q3 results. Should you buy, sell or hold?","Tech Mahindra sharesjumped nearly 4% on Monday after the IT services firm posted a stronger-than-expected third-quarter performance and flagged its strongest deal momentum in five years, prompting brokerages to reassess the stock’s near-term risk-reward even as valuations remain stretched.Shares of Tech Mahindra climbed as much as 3.8% to Rs 1,734.05 on the BSE on Monday, extending gains after the company reported a year-on-year rise in profit and revenue for the December quarter, alongside record deal wins. For Q3FY26, Tech Mahindra reported a consolidated net profit of Rs 1,122 crore, up 14% from Rs 983.2 crore a year earlier. Sequentially, profit declined 6.03% from Rs 1,194 crore.Revenue from operations rose 8.34% year-on-year to Rs 14,393 crore, while growing 2.85% quarter-on-quarter. Diluted earnings per share stood at Rs 12.64.Brokerages split: hold versus buyThe results triggered a reassessment among brokerages, with opinions split between cautious optimism and outright bullishness.Live EventsNuvamaupgraded Tech Mahindra to 'Hold' from 'Reduce' and raised its target price to Rs 1,650 from Rs 1,350, citing strong Q3 execution and record deal wins. The brokerage said the company “delivered strong Q3FY26 numbers, with revenue growing +1.7% CC QoQ, beating estimates,” and noted that total contract value stood at a record USD 1,096 million.Nuvama said that under CEO Mohit Joshi’s leadership, Tech Mahindra is strengthening its business fundamentals and sustainability while balancing growth and margins. However, it flagged valuation concerns and remained cautious on profitability ambitions. The brokerage said it remains “sceptical on the 15% margin target” and forecasts 14% margins in FY27, which it said would still be a significant achievement. While it said it is turning positive on the company, it added that valuations remain relatively expensive.Motilal Oswal, by contrast, reiterated a 'Buy' rating, arguing that a turnaround in the communications business and s",2026-01-22,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/tech-mahindra-shares-rally-4-after-q3-results-should-you-buy-sell-or-hold/articleshow/126668166.cms,neutral,economictimes,,,,1

"Union Budget FY27: 5 decisions that could shape markets, Kotak Securities says","India’sFY27 Union Budgetis likely to hinge on five quiet but consequential policy choices that could steer both equity and bond markets in the year ahead, according to Kotak Securities. In a volatile global backdrop marked by geopolitical tensions and trade uncertainty, the brokerage expects the government to prioritise stability over spectacle, slowing the pace of fiscal consolidation, sustaining capital expenditure, and leaning on buoyant non-tax revenues, even as higher borrowing risks unsettling the bond market.Kotak Securities projects the Centre’s gross fiscal deficit at 4.3% of GDP in FY27, only marginally lower than the estimated 4.4% in FY26, signalling a deliberate easing in the consolidation glide path. “India’s current economic backdrop, shaped by geopolitical tensions and trade uncertainty, warrants a steady, growth-supportive stance in the FY2027 Union Budget,” the brokerage said.1) A slower fiscal consolidation pathAt the core of Kotak’s Budget math is a conscious decision to slow fiscal tightening. The brokerage noted that the Centre’s debt/GDP target of 50±1% by FY2031 allows room for a modest annual reduction of 10–20 basis points in the fiscal deficit ratio. Against that backdrop, it expects FY27 GFD/GDP to settle at 4.3%, reflecting continued capex momentum, modest tax buoyancy and a largeRBI surplus transfer.2) Limited scope for fiscal stimulus or populismAfter income-tax relief and GST rate cuts in FY26, Kotak sees little headroom for large, market-pleasing giveaways. “Following income tax relief and GST rate cuts in FY2026, and given the prevailing fiscal constraints, we see a limited scope for any large fiscal stimulus in the FY2027 budget,” the report said. With committed expenditure accounting for around 60% of revenue expenditure, outright populism would risk straining the fiscal balance, even as several states have pivoted toward cash-transfer schemes.3) Capex remains the policy anchorThe third key decision, Kotak said, will be to keep th",2026-01-22,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/union-budget-fy27-5-decisions-that-could-shape-markets-kotak-securities-says/articleshow/126680424.cms,neutral,economictimes,,,,1

Hidden Value? 8 stocks with enterprise value higher than market cap,"A high EV to MCAP ratio suggests that a company carries significant debt or liabilities relative to its market value, indicating increased financial risk. Among Nifty200 stocks, eight companies stand out with enterprise values significantly higher than their market capitalisation (EV as of September ’25), based on StockEdge’s valuation scan data.This could also mean the company has limited cash reserves or a disproportionately high enterprise value compared to its equity, possibly affecting investor confidence and the company’s market value. Enterprise Value (EV) is the total value of a company, including its market capitalisation, debt, and excluding cash. It represents the cost of acquiring the entire business.

Credit costs rise for Shapoorji Pallonji Group firm as refinancing timeline slips,"Mumbai:Shapoorji Pallonji Group'sPorteast Investmenthas seen the cost of itsprivate credit financingrise about 2 percentage points to 21.75% after a contractual step-up linked to payment milestones was triggered, people familiar with the matter told ET. The repricing applies to roughly ₹28,500 crore ($3.3 billion) of debt backed by 9.2% of Tata Sons' stake.The step-up was triggered afterGoswami Infratech, a borrower linked to the structure, did not complete a refinancing by December end, said the people cited above. Although not a covenant breach, the delay requires existing borrowings to be repriced if fresh debt was raised at a higher cost.Porteast specifically approved extension in the refinancing date for Goswami to April 30, 2026.A Shapoorji spokesperson did not immediately respond to ET's request for a comment.In November, the group had reached out to investors with revised terms on the Goswami bonds. The facility, raised in June 2023 at 18.75%, was originally slated for optional repayment in December 2025. Goswami has since proposed aligning the optional redemption date with the final maturity in April 2026.Live EventsPartly RepaidSP has repaid partially using proceeds from Afcons Infrastructure's listing and the monetisation of Gopalpur Port and Dharamtar Port, although about $1.7 billion remains outstanding.Separately, the group raised fresh bridge debt in December at 21.75%, the sources said. A source mentioned that given positive developments in the past few months on theTata Sons stake, investors were willing to lend funds cheaper, but given existing Goswami debt at 21.75%, even the bridge debt is priced at the same level. Shapoorji Pallonji Group unit privately placed about ₹1,600 crore of one-yearNCDswith globalcredit investorsincluding Deutsche Bank, Farallon Capital and Canyon Partners.""Around mid-December, Goswami repaid individual and minority retail investors in full, using funds drawn from the Farallon, Canyon and Deutsche Bank facility,"" one per",2026-01-22,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/credit-costs-rise-for-shapoorji-pallonji-group-firm-as-refinancing-timeline-slips/articleshow/126425083.cms,neutral,economictimes,,,,1

Tiger Global's treaty 'abuse' case key to how money flows to India,"Mumbai: Overseas strategic investors, offshore private equity and venture capital houses, and foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) active in derivatives have their fingers crossed on the possible outcome of the much-awaitedSupreme Court verdicton the American investment firm Tiger Global (TG) which faces a huge tax demand from India. The crucial judgement which was reserved for months would determine how international investors from Mauritius, Singapore and other treaty countries that serve as key gateways for foreign capital, play and structure their long bets on India stories.DIRECT & INDIRECT TRANSFERThe high-stake feud has its origin in 2018 when TG had sold shares it owned in Flipkart Singapore (which held stocks of Flipkart India) to another foreign investor linked to Walmart. The Flipkart Singapore shares were held by TG entities in Mauritius-which, like Singapore, has a tax treaty with India. Nocapital gains taxwas paid as it was an 'indirect transfer': no shares of Flipkart India was 'directly' transferred; instead TG Mauritius sold shares of Flipkart Singapore which controlled Flipkart India. Under the treaties, investors from treaty jurisdictions are spared capital gains tax for indirect transfer of Indian assets.However, the I-T department questioned the arrangement on the grounds that TG Mauritius was only a vehicle used to escape tax by taking advantage of the treaty. Insisting that TG Mauritius lacked 'substance', the tax office raised a demand of ₹14,500 crore (over $1.7 billion as per today's exchange rate), tossing aside the tax residency certificate (TRC) that TG had received from the Mauritian authorities. This put a question mark on the adequacy of TRC foreign investors use to plan tax.Live EventsThe dispute has now reached a climax. ""The court's decision could have a significant impact on the taxation of global investment funds investing here. Depending on the verdict, investment funds may have to factor in a revised tax cost in their IRR (intern",2026-01-22,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/tiger-globals-treaty-abuse-case-key-to-how-money-flows-to-india/articleshow/126536340.cms,neutral,economictimes,,,,1

"Nifty consolidates below 25,900 as markets await decisive trigger","The truncated week saw the markets largely consolidating in a narrow range, with Nifty ending the week almost flat with a marginal positive bias. There was a trading holiday on Thursday due to the municipal elections in Mumbai.The benchmark index witnessed low participation and remained range-bound throughout, given the lack of any major triggers. Nifty oscillated within a tight band of 426.40 points, marking an intra-week high of 25,899.80 and a low of 25,473.40.India VIXedged slightly higher by 4.10% to 11.37, indicating a marginal uptick in volatility expectations, although it remains within historically benign levels. Nifty closed the week with a minor gain of 11.05 points (+0.04%).AgenciesThe index continues to stay in a defined consolidation zone just below its recent high, exhibiting a broad-ranging behavior without any decisive breakout. Nifty is trading within a horizontal resistance zone marked near 25,900, while it continues to defend the 100-DMA (25,570) on a closing basis. Structurally, the markets are not in a trending phase and appear to be in a time-wise consolidation which suggests that Nifty is awaiting a decisive catalyst. A sustained move above 25,900–26,000 could open up room for a fresh breakout, while a breach below 25,400–25,350 may trigger incremental weakness.Live EventsFor the upcoming week, a quiet-to-cautious start cannot be ruled out unless the index manages to decisively clear 25,900. Key resistance zones are seen at 25,900 and 26,150 levels, while supports are expected around 25,500 and 25,200. A breakdown below these levels may bring the 24,700–24,800 zone back into focus.The weekly RSI stands at 53.31 and remains neutral without showing any bullish or bearish divergence against the price. It reflects a lack of momentum either way. The weekly MACD remains below the signal line and shows mildly increased momentum, with a widening histogram, hinting at slightly elevated downside pressure. The weekly candle is a small-bodied bar with up",2026-01-22,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/nifty-consolidates-below-25900-as-markets-await-decisive-trigger/articleshow/126611826.cms,neutral,economictimes,,,,1

Distribution costs weigh on value of insurance products,"Mumbai: Hefty commissions and rising operating costs are increasingly eroding the value of insurance products, experts said, potentially negating some of the anticipated beneficial impact of zero service taxes on retail products announced in the broadest federal reforms on consumption taxes.Market experts have flagged concerns with credit-linked life policies, non- linked insurance products and motor third party and retail health policies. ""The high cost of operating an insurance company is a huge issue,"" said Avinash Singh, analyst, Emkay Global. ""Insurance distribution cost cannot be determined based on insurers' and distributors' view of their cost structure and profitability goals; rather, the cost of distribution and operations needs to be based on the value delivered by a product to the customer, and such value needs to be either in terms of protection offered or savings returns delivered.""In retail health insurance, higher payouts for new customer acquisition continue, while experts argue that renewal commissions must be sharply reduced to prevent premiums from rising as policyholders age.To be sure, the government waived the goods and services taxes (GST) applicable to retail insurance policies from the third quarter of FY26 in the broadest reforms for the uniform consumption taxes since their introduction in 2017.Concerns are also evident in credit-linked life insurance, where policies meant to protect borrowers and lenders are often bundled into group single-premium products and sold with steep commissions. Because these covers are embedded within group business, commissions are difficult to identify separately.Live EventsMore than a dozen insurance companies exceeded their prescribed expense limit last financial year after the sector regulator removed the product cap on commissions and introduced an overall expense of management cap.Non-linked savings plans are also steadily losing appeal as high costs eat into returns, making them less competitive than o",2026-01-22,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/distribution-costs-weigh-on-value-of-insurance-products/articleshow/126494800.cms,neutral,economictimes,,,,1

"Bharat Coking Coal shares make blockbuster D-St debut, list at 97% premium over IPO price","Shares of Bharat Coking Coal made a stellar debut on stock exchanges on Monday, listing at Rs 45 on the NSE (a 95.6% premium) and Rs 45.21 on the BSE (up 96.6%) over the issue price of Rs 23 per share. The listing follows the company’s Rs 1,071 crore IPO, which was entirely an offer for sale by promoterCoal IndiaLimited, and received an overwhelming response from investors.The issue was subscribed 147 times overall, driven by strong demand across institutional, non-institutional, and retail categories. Before listing, Bharat Coking Coal was valued at Rs 10,711 crore.The IPO, open for subscription between January 9 and January 13, saw particularly strong interest from non-institutional investors, while qualified institutional buyers also oversubscribed their portion multiple times. Retail participation was robust, reflecting broad-based appetite for a rare pure-play coking coal producer.Analysts had anticipated a strong debut, supported by high grey market premiums ahead of listing and the company’s strategic importance in India’s steel value chain.Gaurav Garg, research analyst at Lemon Markets Desk, said the response to the issue reflected confidence in the company’s positioning. “The strong response to the Bharat Coking Coal IPO underscores investor confidence in the company’s monopolistic position in India’s coking coal segment and its long-term demand visibility,” he said.Live EventsGarg added that the anchor book provided early validation to the issue, while heavy participation from non-institutional investors signalled expectations of listing gains.Bharat Coking Coal is the largest producer of coking coal in India and accounts for nearly 60% of the country’s domestic coking coal output. Incorporated in 1972, the company operates 34 mines across Jharkhand and West Bengal, including a mix of underground and opencast operations. Its primary customers include steel producers and power companies.The company holds estimated coking coal reserves of about 7,910 million",2026-01-22,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/bharat-coking-coal-shares-list-at-97-premium-over-ipo-price/articleshow/126668041.cms,neutral,economictimes,,,,1

Bernstein warns of regulatory storm for IEX as market-coupling case plays out,"Indian Energy Exchangeis “in the midst of a regulatory storm” and faces heightened policy uncertainty even as recent court developments have lifted investor sentiment,Bernstein Researchsaid, maintaining a cautious stance on thepower tradingplatform amid the ongoing market-coupling debate.Bernstein reiterated an 'Underperform' rating onIEX, saying regulatory risks, rather than operating performance, will be the decisive factor for the stock. The brokerage said three issues matter most for IEX:market coupling, transaction charges and trading volumes. While recent legal signals could provide near-term relief, Bernstein warned that structural risks to earnings remain.“Market coupling – IEX presented a strong case in the lastAPTEL hearing, and we see reasonable odds of APTEL asking for a re-evaluation of the timing of market coupling – which could be a temporary positive,” Bernstein said. However, the brokerage cautioned that any delay in coupling could reopen a more damaging debate. “If coupling gets pushed out, we see high chances of a discussion paper on transaction charges proposing a reduction in basis benchmarks and industry ROE norms. This is the biggest reason for our underperform rating.”On operating momentum, the brokerage struck a more constructive tone, saying volumes “should remain supportive with good coal availability and even some renewable plants being forced to sell on the exchange,” in its view.IEX shares rally as tribunal questions frameworkDespite Bernstein’s caution, IEX shares have rallied sharply this week. The stock closed 4.5% higher at Rs 154.75 on the BSE on Wednesday, January 7, extending gains to about 15% over the past two sessions.Live EventsOn Tuesday, the shares rose 9.3% to close at Rs 146.80 after hitting an intraday high of Rs 153.35, as investor attention turned to developments in the market-coupling case before the Electricity Appellate Tribunal (APTEL).During hearings on petitions challenging the market coupling framework proposed",2026-01-22,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/bernstein-warns-of-regulatory-storm-for-iex-as-market-coupling-case-plays-out/articleshow/126394510.cms,neutral,economictimes,,,,1

That would be the slowest pace in five quarters, weighed down by deteriorating margins forbanks— which have more than 30% weight in the index.The upcoming earnings season will test Indian companies’ recovery momentum after a run of single-digit profit growth in recent quarters. It will set the tone for the current year’s earnings expectations, with investors looking for signs for a turnaround in local equities, which are facing foreign outflows amid a delay in the India-US trade deal.“Earnings are likely to stay soft,” Nuvama Institutional Equities strategists Prateek Parekh and Priyanka Shah wrote in a note. “Going ahead, while a weak rupee and domestic easing could result in a modest top-line recovery, slowing global trade and margin compression pose risks to earnings recovery.”BloombergLive EventsIndia has had a bruising start to the year, with the Nifty 50 falling 1.7% so far in 2026, compared with MSCI Asia Pacific Index’s nearly 3% advance.

Bharat Coking Coal IPO GMP shows 54% listing pop. What to expect ahead of listing tomorrow?,"The grey market is flashing loud signals ahead of Bharat Coking Coal Ltd’s stock-market debut, with the IPO commanding a premium that points to a potential 54% listing gain even after a last-minute delay pushed the listing to Monday. For investors who piled into one of the most heavily subscribed PSU offerings in recent memory, the question now is not whether demand was strong, but whether the froth can sustain once the stock hits the exchanges.As of Sunday morning, January 18, thegrey market premiumfor theBharat Coking Coal IPOstood at Rs 12.4, implying an estimated listing price of about Rs 35.4 against the issue price of Rs 23 per share. That translates into an expected upside of 53.91%, according to grey market data, reflecting the intensity of unofficial market interest a day before the rescheduled debut.Listing pushed back, enthusiasm intactBharat Coking Coal, a subsidiary of Maharatna PSUCoal India, was originally slated to list on January 16. The debut was postponed to January 19 after stock exchanges announced a trading holiday on January 15 due to municipal corporation elections in Maharashtra, as communicated in updated exchange filings. The allotment was finalised on January 14, with refunds expected to be processed on January 16.Despite the brief pause, sentiment in the grey market has remained firm. Traders and investors continue to price in a strong debut, suggesting that the delay has done little to dent confidence around the offering.Live EventsOne of the most oversubscribed PSU IPOsThe numbers from the subscription window tell their own story.

Sebi proposes easing cash settlement norms for foreign investors to cut funding costs,"Capital markets regulator Sebi has proposed allowing foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) to net their cash obligations for stock market transactions, a move aimed at improving operational efficiency and reducing funding costs, especially during high-volume trading days such as index rebalancing.In a consultation paper released on January 16, Sebi said the current settlement framework requires FPIs to settle all cash market trades on a gross basis at the custodian level, even if their buy and sell positions offset each other on the same day.The paper comes in the wake of heavy selling from foreign investors since the last one year. FIIs have sold $21 billion of equities from the beginning of 2025.While custodians eventually settle with clearing corporations on a net basis, FPIs are required to bring in full funds for purchases and deliver securities for sales separately, leading to higher temporary liquidity requirements.Sebi noted that this structure often leaves FPIs underinvested for at least one day and exposes them to additional costs such as forex conversion slippage and short-term funding expenses. These issues become more pronounced during index reshuffling days, when FPIs execute large buy and sell trades simultaneously.Live EventsUnder the proposed framework, Sebi has suggested permitting ""netting of funds"" for outright buy and outright sell transactions carried out by an FPI in the cash market on the same settlement day. This would allow sale proceeds to be adjusted against purchase obligations, requiring FPIs to fund only the net cash amount.However, trades where an investor both buys and sells the same security within the same settlement cycle will continue to be settled on a gross basis, in line with existing rules.Sebi said discussions with custodians, clearing corporations and stock exchanges highlighted potential risks, including higher chances of trade rejection and increased settlement risk for custodians. Market participants also flagged concerns a",2026-01-22,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/sebi-proposes-easing-cash-settlement-norms-for-foreign-investors-to-cut-funding-costs/articleshow/126564898.cms,neutral,economictimes,,,,1

Mutual funds trim Paytm stake for first time since IPO; retail exits deepen. What’s next for investors?,"India’s domesticmutual fundspared their stake inOne97 CommunicationsLtd., the parent of payments aggregatorPaytm, during the October–December quarter. This marks the first time mutual funds have reduced their holding in the company since its stock market debut in November 2021, after steadily increasing their exposure over the past three years.As per the latest shareholding data, mutual funds held a 14.34% stake in Paytm at the end of the December quarter, down from 16.25% at the end of the September quarter.At the end of the September quarter, Motilal Oswal MF, Nippon India MF, Mirae AssetMFand Bandhan MF featured as the prominent funds who held stake in Paytm. In the December shareholding, while the first three names have all trimmed their stake, Bandhan MF's name does not feature in the list. This either means that the fund's stake has dropped below the 1% mark, or it has made its exit from the stock.On the flip side, retail shareholders continued to sell the stock with their shareholding declining for the seventh quarter in a row. For retail shareholders, or those who have an authorized share capital of up to Rs 2 lakh, their shareholding in Paytm has dropped to the lowest level since September 2023.With both mutual funds and retail investors trimming their holdings, the key question now is what lies ahead for Paytm’s shareholders?Live EventsLast month, Goldman Sachs upgraded the stock to Buy from Neutral, signalling a renewed positive stance on the fintech major.

"CLSA flags margin recovery ahead for HDFC Bank, predicts 27% headroom despite weak start to the year","Global brokerageCLSAhas maintained its “Outperform” rating onHDFC Bank, projecting a potential upside of over 27% from current levels, even as the stock remains under pressure in the short term. The brokerage has set atarget priceof Rs 1,200 on the stock, which is currently trading near Rs 943.50 on the BSE, after falling 6.2% from its January high of Rs 1,006.30.Addressing investor concerns around slower deposit growth and the lack of immediate margin improvement post-merger, CLSA believes these issues are either temporary or misunderstood.It expects FY27 to be a ""bounce-back year"" for the bank, supported by improving operating dynamics and cost rationalisation.Valuations, according to CLSA, are now attractive, with HDFC Bank trading at a 10–12% price-to-book (PB) discount toICICI Bank. The brokerage believes this valuation gap may not be justified in the long term, especially as cost discipline improves.Core operating expenses (opex) are expected to grow at 5–7% year-on-year, compared to 10% growth in loans. CLSA adds that slower hiring and reallocation of staff to customer-facing roles are signs of operational tightening.Live EventsThe brokerage forecasts HDFC Bank’s core pre-provision operating profit (PPOP) to grow at high-teens levels over the next two years, supported by operational efficiency and loan book expansion. Althoughreturn on equity(ROE) is currently lower than ICICI Bank’s, CLSA notes that at 1.7x FY28 PB, the risk-reward for HDFC Bank appears “extremely favourable.”HDFC Bank share price historyOver the past six months, the stock of HDFC Bank has seen a decline of 4.74%, reflecting a gradual downward drift in sentiment. In the last three months alone, it has slipped by 3.39%, while the one-month performance has been even more subdued, with a sharper drop of 5.54%.Technical charts indicate weakness in HDFC Bank sharesOn charts, the shares of HDFC Bank are currently placed below all their significant daily exponential moving averages.

FIIs boost stake in Suzlon Energy to 23.73% in December quarter,"Foreign Institutional Investors (FIIs) have steadily increased their stake inSuzlon Energy, raising their holding from 22.70% in September 2025 to 23.73% in the December quarter. This is the highest FII ownership level seen in the past four quarters, reflecting strengthening confidence among global institutional investors. Given thatFIIstypically follow a research-driven and long-term investment strategy, this uptick in their stake serves as a positive signal for retail investors. It indicates that institutional investors may be positioning for potential future gains, even as the stock has faced near-term volatility.In contrast, domestic mutual funds (MFs) reduced their holdings for the second consecutive quarter, with their stake slipping to 4.82%. Similarly, small retail investors (resident individuals holding shares worth up to Rs 2 lakh) marginally trimmed their exposure, with their shareholding falling from 26.20% in September to 25.89% in December — suggesting either profit-booking or a more cautious stance.The overall shareholding structure at the end of December 2025 shows promoters holding 11.73% with zero pledged shares, providing comfort on governance. FIIs command a significant 23.73% stake, DIIs account for 9.24%, and retail investors collectively hold 39.07%, split between small investors at 26.20% and larger resident individuals at 12.87%.On the performance front, Suzlon Energy has delivered a muted return over the past year, declining nearly 14%, but its long-term performance over three years has been remarkable, delivering nearly 400% gains for investors. Analysts remain optimistic, with Trendlyne data showing a “STRONG BUY” consensus from 10 analysts, and an average price target implying upside potential of around 45% from current levels.From a valuation and technical perspective, the stock trades at a PE ratio of 21.18 and a PB ratio of 10.96. Its 14-day RSI stands at 32.5, approaching oversold territory, while technically, it remains in a bearish",2026-01-22,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/fiis-boost-stake-in-suzlon-energy-to-23-73-in-december-quarter/articleshow/126561049.cms,neutral,economictimes,,,,1

Smallcap stocks jump up to 62% this week! How many do you own?,"After a bruising 2025, when the Nifty Smallcap 100 index fell nearly 6%, 2026 is shaping up to be another difficult year—at least judging by January’s early trend. While the index is already down about 2%, several pockets across sectors such as metal, financials among others have stood out as clear outliers, delivering sharp gains of up to 62% in just a week. Here’s the full list of the best-performing smallcap stocks in the week gone by. The stock has risen 62% this week to emerge as the top-performing smallcap stock. It manufactures electric vehicles (EVs), primarily electric two-wheelers and three-wheelers, under brands like Joy e-bike and Joy E-Rik, focusing on creating a sustainable EV ecosystem in India. The stock has gained 40% this week, placing it among the strongest smallcap performers.

Goldman Sachs raises Reliance Industries’ share price target ahead of Q3 results next week. Here’s why,"Goldman Sachshas raised its 12-month price target onReliance Industriesto Rs 1,835 a share, implying an upside of about 25% from current levels, exactly a week ahead of the company’s December quarter (Q3FY26) earnings. The brokerage has reiterated its Buy rating, arguing that near-term moderation in retail will be offset by improving refining fundamentals and steady momentum in telecom, keeping Reliance’s medium-term earnings trajectory intact.In a note dated January 9, Goldman Sachs said it has refreshed its estimates forRelianceby marking assumptions to evolving trends across segments. Like-for-like with peers, the brokerage expects Q3 earnings growth in retail to moderate due to weak discretionary spending, base effects and festive timing. However, this is likely to be partly offset by a strong refining-led performance in the oil-to-chemicals (O2C) business. As a result, overall earnings remain largely unchanged despite tweaks at the segment level.Reliance Industries' stock price has corrected about 8% in the last couple of trading sessions after outperforming the Sensex, Nifty and peers over the past year. The international brokerage attributes the recent pullback to investor concerns around Reliance’s exposure to Russian crude and softer retail growth momentum. But analysts believe these worries are overdone and see limited impact on the company’s medium-term earnings profile. Here’s what the brokerage is saying about Q3.Refining remains the key pillarGoldman Sachs analysts expect O2C EBITDA in Q3FY26 to rise 11% quarter-on-quarter and 16% year-on-year, driven by stronger refining earnings that more than offset a sequential decline in petrochemicals. Refining cracks improved during the quarter amid permanent refinery closures, unplanned outages and disruptions to Russian product exports, tightening global product markets. Lower Dubai–Brent spreads and easing Saudi crude premiums have also improved the cost curve positioning for complex Asian refiners such as Re",2026-01-22,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/goldman-sachs-raises-reliance-industries-share-price-target-ahead-of-q3-results-next-week-heres-why/articleshow/126431375.cms,neutral,economictimes,,,,1

Will Budget bring back FIIs? Morgan Stanley's Ridham Desai expects 3 reforms to revive foreign flows,"After $21 billion of relentless selling by foreign institutional investors (FIIs) since the beginning of 2025, India’s equity strategists are increasingly turning to the UnionBudgetas a potential pivot point. Morgan Stanley’sRidham Desai, who leads the firm’s India equity strategy team, has identified three specific capital market reforms that could meaningfully reverse the FII outflow narrative that has plagued Indian markets.“There has been growing concern about the negative balance of payments and foreign portfolio investor (FPI) selling. In this context, it is quite possible that the Budget proposes broadening the base of foreign portfolio investors, allowing more pools of capital to access Indian stocks,” Desai said in a Budget strategy note.The two other reforms could focus on simplifying buyback taxation—which currently risks distorting capital structures and hurting long-term capital market flows—and further enhancing tax benefits at GIFT City, he said.As global financial flows increasingly route through international financial centres, GIFT City has emerged as a potential hub but remains underdeveloped compared with peers such as Singapore and Hong Kong. By sharpening tax incentives and strengthening regulatory frameworks, the government could attract more foreign capital into Indian securities through platforms such as the Gateway International Exchange. This would create additional avenues for FII participation, particularly for investors facing regulatory or structural constraints in traditional market-access mechanisms.India has seen around $2 billion in net foreign investor outflows so far this year, following a $19 billion sell-off in 2025.Live Events“It appears the market is expecting modest fiscal consolidation to protect growth, flat to higher capital spending as a percentage of GDP, and some additional tax incentives for manufacturing,” he said, adding that the Budget is likely to focus on deficit reduction, government capital expenditure, the deb",2026-01-22,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/will-budget-bring-back-fiis-morgan-stanleys-ridham-desai-expects-3-reforms-to-revive-foreign-flows/articleshow/126559892.cms,neutral,economictimes,,,,1

Market Trading Guide: Buy IEX and ABB India on Thursday for up to 6% gains,"Nifty ended with marginal losses on Wednesday, marking its third consecutive decline amid selling pressure in auto and energy stocks, even as IT shares provided some support.Rupak De, Senior Technical Analyst at LKP Securities, said the near-term trend remains sluggish, with the Nifty likely to trade in the 26,000–26,300 range. “The Nifty remained volatile during the session, although the trading range was relatively narrow. On the downside, it found support at the 21-EMA before closing higher. A decisive fall below 26,000 could trigger further weakness, while a sustained move above 26,300 would be needed for a directional upside,” De said.

Wipro shares rally 4% ahead of Q3 results. What are brokerages expecting?,"Wiproshares gained momentum ahead of its December quarter results, rising 3.7% intraday to hit a high of Rs 269.80 on the BSE. The rally reflects investor optimism as the IT major prepares to announce its Q3 earnings later today, with the Street watching for updates on margins, deal wins and the impact of recent acquisitions such as Harman.According to an average of estimates from six brokerages, Wipro’s profit after tax for Q3FY26 is expected to rise by just 0.4% year-on-year. Revenue is seen growing at a muted pace of around 4% compared to the same period last year, amid subdued client spending and cautious macroeconomic conditions.Sequentially, growth is expected to remain sluggish.Brokerages expect Wipro’s IT services revenue to grow between 0.5% and 1.2% quarter-on-quarter in constant currency terms, aided by contributions from recent acquisitions.However, the Harman integration, while expected to provide a one-month revenue boost this quarter, is also likely to dilute near-term margins.Live EventsHSBC projects around 0.5% constant currency growth, translating to a 1.2% sequential increase in dollar revenue. However, it flagged a 30 basis point currency headwind and warned of subdued margins due to furloughs and integration costs.Centrum Broking sees 1.2% QoQ growth in constant currency, including 0.5% organic growth and 0.7% from Harman. It expects EBIT margins to decline by 22 basis points sequentially, largely due to the ramp-up costs of large deals.Nomura echoed similar expectations, projecting 0.5% revenue growth in constant currency and a modest 20 bps drop in margins, partially offset by currency gains.Also read:Infosys shares climb 5% on FY26 guidance hike post Q3 results.

"Sensex falls over 100 points, Nifty below 25,700 amid foreign selling, crude pressure","India’s benchmark indices, the Sensex and the Nifty, edged lower at the open on Wednesday, weighed down by sustained foreign investor selling and firm crude oil prices, which offset support from steady corporate earnings growth.The BSE Sensex slipped 116 points, or 0.14%, to 83,511.29 in early trade, while the Nifty 50 declined 44 points, or 0.17%, to start the day at 25,688, as cautious sentiment persisted across domestic equities.On the 30-stock Sensex,Tata Steel,NTPC, Bharat Electronics,Axis Bankand Mahindra & Mahindra were among the top gainers, rising between 0.4% and 1%. Losses were led byTCS,Asian Paints,Kotak Mahindra Bank,InterGlobe AviationandSun Pharma, which fell between 0.5% and 1%.Broader markets were largely subdued, with small-cap and mid-cap stocks trading flat.Both the Sensex and the Nifty have declined in six of the past seven sessions, shedding about 2.5% and 2.3%, respectively, underscoring the recent pullback in Indian equities.Live EventsExpert viewsSince the beginning of the year 2026, geopolitical events are dominating the global news, and some of these events may have a serious impact on the markets, but the markets have not been impacted significantly, said Dr. VK Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist at Geojit Investments.""President Trump’s order imposing 25 % tariffs on countries trading with Iran is unlikely to impact India significantly since India-Iran trade is small at around $ 1.6 billion. China will be impacted hugely. How the Iranian crisis will unfold and how the U.S. reacts to the developments in Iran remain to be seen. The use of tariffs as a weapon by Trump means the world is likely to suffer from a tariff-ridden trade system for sometime,"" said Vijayakumar.""Stock investment can be frustrating at times; it can disappoint for a long. What smart investors should do in uncertain volatile times like now is to remain invested and continue investing in fairly valued quality growth stocks for the long-term,"" said Vijayakumar.FII/D",2026-01-22,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/sensex-falls-over-100-points-nifty-below-25700-amid-foreign-selling-crude-pressure/articleshow/126517070.cms,neutral,economictimes,,,,1
"Mumbai poll holiday for BSE, NSE draws flak from Zerodha's Nithin Kamath","Indian stock exchangesremained shut on Thursday, January 15, due to municipal corporation elections in Maharashtra, resulting in a full-day trading holiday across all segments – a move that sparked debate after Zerodha CEONithin Kamathvoiced his concerns on social media.While the day was initially classified as a settlement holiday, exchanges issued revised circulars last week declaring a complete trading halt, citing expected bank closures across the state.Nithin Kamath took to his social media platform X (formerly Twitter) to question the rationale behind halting market operations for a local civic event, especially in a globally connected financial system.Kamath argued that shutting down exchanges with international linkages for a municipal election highlighted poor planning and a lack of consideration for second-order effects.Citing famed investorCharlie Munger, he wrote, “Show me the incentive, and I will show you the outcome,” suggesting that the market holiday persists because no key stakeholders are incentivized to challenge it.Live Events— Nithin0dha (@Nithin0dha)He further added that such moves underscore how far Indian markets still have to go before being taken seriously by global investors.Kamath’s post sparked immediate debate, drawing a response fromSamir Arora, founder of Helios Capital, who questioned the consistency of such arguments.Arora replied on the same platform: “I hope you will say the same thing when the market is open on Sunday, February 1,” referring to the government’s decision to keep markets open on Budget Day despite it falling on a weekend.“If our exchange has international linkages, is it not unfair to foreign investors to have the market open on Sunday?” he added.— Iamsamirarora (@Iamsamirarora)The discussion has put a spotlight on the broader issue of exchange operational planning and its alignment with India’s aspirations to be a globally significant market.Meanwhile, commodity trading on the Multi-Commodity Exchange (MCX) was p",2026-01-22,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/mumbai-poll-holiday-for-bse-nse-draws-flak-from-zerodha-co-founder-nithin-kamath/articleshow/126538141.cms,neutral,economictimes,,,,1

"Mid-tier IT firms set to outshine largecaps in Q3. Brokerages list 10 buys, 4 sells","The October–December quarter could reveal a clear divergence within the Indian IT companies, with mid-tier companies once again outperforming their tier-I peers amid a seasonally weak quarter. Brokerages expect muted revenue growth across the board over the near term amid furloughs, lower utilisation and continued macro uncertainty.The earnings season begins with the announcement of earnings byTata Consultancy Services(TCS) andHCL Technologieson Monday, January 12.HDFC Securities sees mid-sized tech firms better positioned to deliver relatively stronger sequential performance. It has pegged tier-1 players to deliver a 0.6 to 2.1% sequential CC growth in Q3, while the tier-II companies are likely to post CC growth in the range of -1.8% to +3.4%.ElaraCapital echoes a similar sentiment in its preview note, expecting midcaps to outperform largecaps in Q3. The revenue will be impacted by furloughs and lower utilisation in Q3FY26, it said, while noting that the deal momentum could continue across its IT services coverage universe, as clients continue to spend on next-gen technologies such as cloud transformation, data & analytics and AI.Giving a company-wise break-up, Elara pegs 3% sequential growth in dollar revenue forCoforgeand Persistent Systems.

Amagi Media Labs IPO Day 1: Subscribed just 4% in early hours. Check GMP and other key details,"Amagi Media Labs, a data-driven advertising technology firm specialising in connected TV and digital video advertising, launched its IPO today. In the early hours, the subscription stood at just 4%, with 9.73 lakh shares bid against the 2.72 crore shares on offer.The IPO is seeing a grey market premium (GMP) of around 4%, signalling modest expectations for listing gains amid a volatile broader equity market and increased scrutiny of valuations in new-age tech offerings.The issue is coming at a time when primary market sentiment is selective, with investors increasingly distinguishing between cash-generating businesses and high-growth but loss-making platforms.Amagi Media Labs IPO subscription statusOn the first day of its IPO, as of 12:20 PM, Amagi Media Labs’ issue was subscribed just 3% overall, indicating a slow start.Live EventsRetail Individual Investors (RIIs) showed relatively stronger interest, subscribing 15% of the 50.73 lakh shares allocated to them.Non-Institutional Investors (NIIs) subscribed only 2% of their 76.09 lakh shares, reflecting tepid participation from this segment.Qualified Institutional Buyers (QIBs) have not yet placed any bids for the 1.45 crore shares reserved for them, suggesting cautious sentiment among large institutional players.This early subscription pattern points to selective investor interest, with retail investors showing some confidence while institutional participation remains subdued.Amagi Media Labs IPO GMP todayAccording to unofficial market sources, the grey market premium (GMP) for Amagi Media Labs’ IPO is around 4%, translating to Rs 16 over the issue price of Rs 361. This is a relatively cautious signal compared with the double-digit premiums typically seen during stronger primary market cycles.Based on this, the IPO’s estimated listing price is around Rs 377. The modest GMP reflects both the current risk-averse sentiment in equities and investor caution towards technology and internet-related companies, given the mixe",2026-01-22,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/amagi-media-labs-ipo-day-1-subscribed-just-4-in-early-hours-check-gmp-and-other-key-details/articleshow/126499899.cms,neutral,economictimes,,,,1

"Vedanta’s Rs 2,500 crore ESOP windfall turns factory floors into shareholder ranks","Vedanta Ltdhas quietly built one of India’s broadest employee-wealth engines, delivering a cumulative Rs 2,500 crore financial impact to staff over the past five years through deeply discounted stock options, an approach that is now reshaping compensation norms in Indian manufacturing.The metals-to-oil conglomerate said its latest grant,ESOP 2025, is valued at more than Rs 500 crore alone and brings nearly 1,200 employees, many of them fresh graduates, into its shareholder base for the first time. Shares under the programme are allotted at Re 1, among the lowest exercise prices in the country, magnifying gains as Vedanta’s stock trades near record highs.From paycheques to equity stakesUnlike the narrower, top-heavy equity plans common across Indian industry, Vedanta’s ESOPs now cover nearly 40% of its workforce across plants, functions and career levels, the company said. Freshers and early-career professionals can receive allocations worth up to 30% of fixed pay over a standard three-year vesting cycle, a rarity among large conglomerates.The most recent vesting cycle, ESOP 2022, delivered more than 80% share value appreciation, generating over Rs 300 crore in employee wealth. The company said this linkage between operational performance and employee rewards has become a core feature of its compensation philosophy after more than two decades of continuous ESOP administration.Also read |Eternal Q3 Results: Cons profit zooms 73% YoY to Rs 102 crore, revenue soars 201%; Deepinder Goyal steps down as CEOLive EventsBy placing equity in the hands of engineers, plant teams and middle management, groups traditionally excluded from such rewards, Vedanta is betting that shared ownership will translate into stronger alignment as it navigates volatile commodity markets and an energy transition.(Disclaimer: Recommendations, suggestions, views and opinions given by the experts are their own.

Groww shares gain 3% as Motilal Oswal initiates coverage with Buy rating. Here are 4 reasons,"Shares of newly-listedBillionbrains Garage Ventures, the parent company ofGroww, rallied as much as 3.2% to their day’s high of Rs 160 on the BSE on Tuesday after Motilal Oswal initiated coverage with a Buy rating, citing strong growth prospects in the coming quarters.With a price target of Rs 185, the domestic brokerage implies an upside potential of nearly 20% from current market levels. To be sure, shares of the company are trading 20% below its all- time high of Rs 194. Here’s why experts are bullish on the counter.Market share gains:Analysts say Groww continues to maintain a strong competitive position in the broking space, with its cash ADTO (average daily turnover) market share holding steady at 23–24%. The platform has also made sharp gains in the derivatives segment, where market share has risen to 14.4% from 9.7%, despite operating in a challenging regulatory environment. Notably, even after increasing the minimum brokerage to Rs 5 from Rs 2, active users in the cash segment have continued to trend higher across segments, indicating price inelasticity and providing Groww with a clear pricing lever to cushion against potential future headwinds.The company is rolling out new trading tools targeted at “power traders” to deepen engagement and improve monetization. Supported by continuous product innovation, Groww’s higher-value customer base is expanding, resulting in larger order sizes and improved revenue yield. While the share of brokerage revenue is expected to moderate to 67% by FY28 from 85% in FY25, absolute brokerage revenues are projected to grow at a 16% CAGR over FY25–28.Affluent-led wealth management entry:Groww’s affluent user base has expanded at nearly twice the pace of its overall platform growth, with around 0.3 million affluent customers accounting for approximately 33% of total assets on the platform. This skew towards higher-value customers is creating meaningful opportunities for multi-product engagement, deeper wallet share and the develo",2026-01-22,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/groww-shares-gain-3-as-motilal-oswal-initiates-coverage-with-buy-rating-here-are-4-reasons/articleshow/126365264.cms,neutral,economictimes,,,,1

"Loan-deposit ratio to stay high, banks set to go for CDs, bonds","MUMBAI:Credit growthis expected to continue outpacing deposit mobilisation in the current financial year and the next, prompting banks to bridge the funding gap through increased issuance of certificate of deposits, analysts at India Ratings said.The pace of rise in bank profitability is likely to bottom out this fiscal year, and gradually improve in FY27 as funding pressures ease andnet interest margins(NIMs) stabilise, the agency said in its outlook on the financial sector for FY27.The rating agency expects advances growth to remain at 13% for FY27, unchanged from FY26. That would outpace deposit growth, which is expected at 11.4% in FY27, from 10.7% in FY 26. The loan to deposit ratio is expected to rise to 83.2% in FY27 from 81.9% in FY 26 and 80.3% in FY25, potentially constraining incremental growth.""Elevatedloan deposit ratios(LDRs) remain a constraining factor for the system at 81.9%. Banks are expected to bridge the gap between loans and deposits by tapping the CD and the corporate bond market,"" said Karan Gupta, head - financial institutions, India Ratings & Research.Gross non performing assets (GNPA) is projected to fall to 1.9% in FY26 and 1.7% in FY27 from 2.2% in FY25 . For non bank finance companies, the agency expects moderate growth as companies would likely be selective in lending to customers, specially of the MSME segment.NBFCsare projected to record a moderated loan growth rate of 15%-16%, lower than earlier years. Credit growth for NBFCs stood at 18% in FY26Live Events""FY27 is expected to be a year of measured growth for NBFCs, as they will navigate asset quality challenges across multiple segments. Lower funding costs will provide some relief, but stricter customer selection is likely to compress yields, limiting profitability,"" Gupta said.Addas a Reliable and Trusted News SourceAdd Now!(You can now subscribe to ourETMarkets WhatsApp channel) (You can now subscribe to ourETMarkets WhatsApp channel)",2026-01-22,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/loan-deposit-ratio-to-stay-high-banks-set-to-go-for-cds-bonds/articleshow/126536528.cms,neutral,economictimes,,,,1

"Asian stocks fall as optimism fades, US bonds hold gains","Asian equities edged lower for a second day as a record-breaking rally lost steam. Treasuries held gains after rising in US trading amid mixed US economic data.Stocks opened lower in Japan and South Korea. A gauge of global stocks and the S&P 500 Index both posted their first declines of 2026 on Wednesday. Samsung Electronics Co. fell 1.5% even after quarterly profit more than tripled to a record high on global demand for AI servers.Treasury 10-year yields fell three basis points to 4.15% Wednesday after data showed signs of weakness in US employment, which kept alive bets for at least two Federal Reserve interest-rate cuts this year. Gold and silver steadied after falling for the first time this week.“The data flow overnight was relatively mixed and that manifested as a mixed session on global markets,” Kyle Rodda, a senior analyst at Capital.com, wrote in a note. “The macroeconomic data also added to the choppiness on Wall Street.”The moves were a sign the optimism that has boosted risk assets since the start of the year may be starting to wane in the face of risinggeopolitical uncertaintyand a mixed outlook for the global economy. A busy calendar awaits traders this week, with Friday’s US payrolls report coinciding with a Supreme Court ruling on President Donald Trump’s global tariffs.Live EventsStocks have been rallying on optimism over solid earnings growth and inflation remaining sufficiently contained for the Fed to keep cutting borrowing costs. That rosy view has persisted despite a worsening geopolitical backdrop, including US actions in Venezuela, its threats of intervention elsewhere and rising tensions between China and Japan.Global affairs remained in focus Wednesday as US forces seized two more sanctioned oil tankers as part of its energy quarantine of Venezuela.

"Swiggy sees FII, mutual fund buying for third consecutive quarter. Time to buy the dip?","Swiggyis drawing steady interest from large institutional investors, including Foreign Institutional Investors (FIIs) and mutual funds (MFs). When such institutions consistently increase their stake in a company, it often reflects strong confidence, as these investors usually commit capital only after detailed research. Retail investors often watch these trends closely to identify potential opportunities.According to the latest shareholding data for the December 2025 quarter, both FIIs and MFs have raised their stakes in Swiggy. FIIs increased their holdings from 12.23% to 16.07%, marking the third consecutive quarter of growth. Meanwhile, mutual funds raised their stake from 11.89% to 17.23%, continuing a trend that has lasted five consecutive quarters. Notably, MFs have never reduced their stake in Swiggy since its listing in November 2024, signalling long-term confidence in the company.Despite this institutional interest, Swiggy’s stock has underperformed over the past year, declining around 30% and currently trading at Rs 344, below its IPO price of Rs 390. This highlights the contrast between short-term market performance and long-term institutional confidence.On Monday, as of 1.05 pm, Swiggy’s stock was down 2.20% at Rs 343.85, with a market capitalisation of approximately Rs 94,885 crore.Trendlyne forecaster data shows that 25 analysts give Swiggy a consensus ‘BUY’ rating, with a target price implying a 42% upside from current levels.Live EventsOn the technical front, the 14-day Relative Strength Index (RSI) stands at 28.7. In technical analysis, an RSI below 30 is generally considered oversold, which means the stock may have been sold off excessively in the short term. This condition often signals a potential buying opportunity, as the stock could rebound once selling pressure eases.However, the stock’s moving averages paint a more cautious picture. Swiggy is currently trading below all eight major Simple Moving Averages (SMAs), a situation that typically in",2026-01-22,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/swiggy-sees-fii-mutual-fund-buying-for-third-consecutive-quarter-time-to-buy-the-dip/articleshow/126479950.cms,neutral,economictimes,,,,1

However, the sectoral portfolio level may see a reversing trend only from March 2026, experts tracking the segment said.Live EventsThe small NBFC-MFIs without strong funding back-up are still facing headwinds.""Funding access remains a hurdle for small and mid-sized players, whereas large players’ reasonable funding positions support expected disbursement growth in FY27,"" India Ratings & Research said in a note.Equifax said the November portfolio size contracted to Rs 3.40 lakh crore from Rs 3.42 lakh crore as of September 30, 2025.

The court verdict could either ignite a sharp rally in theSensexandNiftyor deepen the volatility that has already battered Dalal Street this week.If the apex court strikes down the tariffs, India could be among the biggest beneficiaries globally, given the outsized impact of Trump's 50% duties on Indian exports and the looming threat of a devastating 500% tariff on countries importing Russian oil, legislation Trump recently approved that would hit India's energy security and trade competitiveness hard.Market participants are watching not just for the verdict itself, but for the details: whether the court delivers a complete takedown of the tariff regime or a partial ruling that leaves room for continued trade friction.""After the sharp correction yesterday triggered by the possibility of about 500% tariff on India under the provisions of theRussia Sanctioning Actapproved by President Trump, the market will be focused on the verdict expected today from the US Supreme Court on the legality ofTrump tariffs,"" said Dr VK Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist at Geojit Investments Limited. ""There is a high probability of the verdict going against Trump. But the details are significant: that is, whether it would be a partial striking down of the tariffs or completely declaring the tariffs illegal. The market reaction would depend on the details.""If the Supreme Court declares Trump tariffs illegal, there would be a rally in India since India has been the worst affected by the 50% tariffs, Vijayakumar added.Live EventsA ruling against the Trump-era tariffs could provide immediate relief to risk assets worldwide, withIndian equitiespositioned as key beneficiaries. Analysts say such an outcome would",2026-01-22,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/us-supreme-court-verdict-on-trump-tariff-tonight-how-sensex-nifty-may-get-impacted/articleshow/126429337.cms,neutral,economictimes,,,,1
"Rs 2.5 lakh crore IPO boom in 2026 could create ‘liquidity drain’, says HDFC Securities; pegs Nifty at 28,720","The Indian equity market heads into 2026 facing an unusual paradox. On the one hand, optimism around growth, earnings recovery and policy support is building. On the other, a flood of new listings threatens to stretch liquidity and test investor appetite. According to HDFC Securities, the coming year could well be defined by how markets navigate this delicate balance.The most immediate challenge is the sheer scale of theIPO pipeline. More than 190 companies are expected to tap the primary market in 2026, collectively seeking to raise over Rs 2.5 lakh crore. Such a heavy issuance calendar raises a fundamental question: will the IPO rush end up killing the goose that laid the golden eggs? HDFC Securities flags the risk of a “liquidity drain” in the secondary market as capital is diverted towards new listings. With investor funds being absorbed by fresh paper, trading activity and price discovery in listed stocks could come under pressure.Compounding this concern is the uncertainty around foreign investor flows. Even after a meaningful consolidation in 2025, Indian equities continue to trade at a premium to otheremerging marketssuch as China and Brazil. Foreign institutional investors pulled out nearly Rs 3 lakh crore from Indian equities in 2025. While there is hope that flows could stabilize or even reverse in 2026, HDFC Securities cautions that several factors may still keep foreign capital on the sidelines.That said, the broader global and domestic backdrop offers reasons for guarded optimism. Global trade uncertainty is expected to gradually come down, aided by easing geopolitical tensions and the prospect of tariff reversals. Trump’s trade policies, which have been a major source of disruption, are expected to diminish further as a dominant influence on the global economy. “Emerging markets rotation is anticipated, with India as a key beneficiary,” it added.Within this framework, emerging market rotation is anticipated, with India seen as a key beneficiary.

"Sensex sheds over 1,100 points in 3 days, Nifty slips 1%: 4 key factors behind the stock market decline","Indian equities extended their slide on Wednesday, with the Sensex and Nifty ending lower for a third straight session as selling in heavyweight stocks, rising geopolitical unease and weak global cues combined to sap investor confidence. What began as a narrow pullback has now turned into a sharper retreat, leaving benchmarks firmly in the red for the week.The BSE Sensex has fallen over 1,144 points in three days, sliding from a close of 85,762.01 on January 2 to an intraday low of 84,617.49 on Wednesday. The NSENifty 50has dropped nearly 1% over the same period.The benchmarks pared some losses by the end of the session. The Sensex fell 102 points, or 0.12%, to close at 84,961.14, while the Nifty slipped 38 points, or 0.14%, to end the session at 26,140.75.Here are the key factors behind the market’s decline:1) Selling pressure in heavyweight stocksLosses in index heavyweights continued to exert outsized pressure on the benchmarks.HDFC Bankshares were down 1.7% on Wednesday, whileReliance Industriesshares slipped 0.4%.Trentdeclined 1.4% on the day, after plunging 8.6% in the previous session amid concerns over intensifying competition in the retail segment.Live EventsThe drag from large-cap stocks was also evident a day earlier, when HDFC Bank andRelianceIndustries, the two heaviest constituents on the index, fell 1.5% and 4.3%, respectively, amplifying benchmark losses.The recent market movements have been devoid of any trend and clear direction and actions in a few mega stocks are influencing the overall market disproportionately, said Dr. VK Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist at Geojit Investments, adding that ""For instance, yesterday despite positive institutional buying Nifty drifted down by 71 points, mainly due to sharp declines in two stocks- Reliance and HDFC Bank.

Gainers & Losers: NALCO among 8 stocks that were under the spotlight on Friday,"Jan 9, 2026 Indian headline indices fell for the fifth session in a row amid selling pressure across sectors as D-Street remained concerned over fresh US tariffs. Financials, auto and consumer stocks suffered the most. While the Nifty ended the day at 25,683.30, down 193.55 points or 0.75%, the BSE Sensex closed at 84,180.96, falling 780.18 points or 0.92%. Here are eight stocks that saw action today: Image Source: ETMarkets.com Shares of Manappuram Finance fell 10% intraday to hit the day’s low of aRs 278.55 on the NSE following a Reuters report that said India’s banking regulator has raised objections to Bain Capital’s plan to acquire a controlling stake in the company. The stock recovered some losses to settle with 5.3% cuts at aRs 293. Image Source: ETMarkets.com Shares of Indian Energy Exchange plunged 7.3% to settle at aRs 139.19 on the NSE after APTEL deferred its hearing on CERC’s market coupling order to January 19, 2026. The CERC counsel today asked for more time to take instructions from the regulator over the withdrawal of the order. After today’s correction, the stock is down 9% over the past two sessions following a 14% rally in prior sessions. Image Source: ETMarkets.com Shares of Kitex Garments ended with declines of 7% at aRs 155.01 on the NSE amid concerns over US tariffs on export-facing sectors such as textiles. Selling intensified after US Senator Lindsey Graham said President Donald Trump had approved a bipartisan Russia sanctions bill proposing duties of at least 500% on Russian imports, which could be used to pressure countries including India. Image Source: ETMarkets.com Shares of Elecon Engineering Company tanked over 16% to close at aRs 420.35 on January 9 after the company reported a weak set of numbers for the third quarter of FY26.

Modern Diagnostic shares list at 11% premium over IPO price on BSE SME platform,"Shares ofModern Diagnostic and Research Centrelisted with a 10.5% premium on the BSE SME platform, opening at Rs 99.5 against the issue price of Rs 90. The debut was largely in line with GMP expectations, which had indicated a steady listing. The stock was quoting at a GMP of around 15%, reflecting decent investor interest in the unlisted market.Modern Diagnostic raised Rs 36.9 crore through a fresh issue of 40.99 lakh shares, valuing the company at a pre-issue market capitalisation of about Rs 136 crore. The issue attracted institutional interest as well, with the company raising Rs 10.45 crore from anchor investors ahead of the IPO.Modern Diagnostic operates a diagnostic chain offering pathology and radiology services across India. The company currently runs 21 centres, including 18 laboratories and three diagnostic centres, spread across eight states. Its service portfolio spans routine pathology tests to advanced imaging such as MRI, CT scans, ultrasound and digital X-rays, supported by home sample collection and online reporting.Financially, the company has shown a sharp turnaround in recent years. Revenue rose 15% year-on-year to Rs 78.8 crore in FY25, while profit after tax jumped 55% to Rs 8.97 crore from Rs 5.79 crore a year earlier. EBITDA margins improved meaningfully as scale benefits kicked in and losses seen in earlier years were reversed. As of June 2025, the company reported PAT of Rs 3 crore on income of Rs 22.67 crore, indicating continued operational momentum.IPO proceeds are largely earmarked for growth and balance sheet strengthening. Around Rs 20.7 crore will be used for capital expenditure on medical equipment, Rs 8 crore for working capital, and Rs 1 crore for repayment of borrowings, with the balance allocated to general corporate purposes.Live EventsWith a 15% GMP, Modern Diagnostic's listing expectations are measured rather than euphoric. If broader market sentiment remains stable, the IPO is likely to deliver a respectable debut, though s",2026-01-22,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/modern-diagnostic-shares-to-list-today-check-gmp-ahead-of-debut/articleshow/126385034.cms,neutral,economictimes,,,,1

Reliance Industries shares tumble to deepest oversold level in 5 years. Should you buy the dip before Jio IPO?,"Having lost around $29 billion in market value so far in 2026, shares of billionaire Mukesh Ambani-backedReliance Industries(RIL) are now trading at the most oversold level in the last 5 years amid concerns around a slowdown in retail business and fear of O2C margins taking a hit due to a decline in Russian crude oil imports.So far in the new year, RIL shares are down over 11% in 2026 after Q3 results announced last Friday failed to lift the stock price. On Tuesday, the Nifty bluechip stock, which has the highest market capitalization among all listed companies in India, saw its 14-day relative strength index (RSI), a key momentum indicator, fall to 24, Bloomberg reported.The RSI has never been this low in the last five years, according to the report, signaling high oversold levels. RIL shares are also on track to record the worst start to a year since 2011.Following the Q3 results, most analysts have cut their consolidated estimates on the stock by 1-3%, largely driven by cuts in the retail segment.Out of the 28 brokerages which have a coverage on the stock, the median price target stood at Rs 1,717, which signals 23% upside potential from current market prices. At least 11 analysts have price target of Rs 1,750 or above. Out of them, 7 brokerage houses have targets of Rs 1,800 or above.Live EventsOf the 28 brokerage houses, 26 houses have a buy/add recommendation.The underperformance of the retail segment was attributed to quick commerce expansion, drag in the fashion and lifestyle segment and impact of new labour code.Analysts have also noted that Retail has a high base for 4Q and growth numbers are likely to remain modest in the near term.Near-term triggers highlighted by analysts are Jio listing, tariff hike, ramp-up of new energy ecosystem and retail growth recovery.""We remain constructive on the retail turnaround. Jio has been steadily growing and is poised for value discovery with its announced IPO. The O2C business is seeing incremental improved demand, alt",2026-01-22,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/reliance-industries-shares-tumble-to-deepest-oversold-level-in-5-years-should-you-buy-the-dip-before-jio-ipo/articleshow/126932941.cms,neutral,economictimes,,,,1

"From bloodbath to bounce: Sensex erases 1,000 point shock, Nifty above 25,250 as bargain hunters step in","After wiping out nearly Rs 6 lakh crore in investor wealth and plunging more than 1,000 points earlier in the day, Indian equities clawed their way back on Wednesday, staging a sharp midday rebound as bargain hunters moved into beaten-down heavyweight stocks, though market veterans warned the recovery may be more reflex than revival.By around 1:00 PM, the BSE Sensex had swung back into positive territory, rising 170 points, or 0.2%, to an intraday high of 82,350.34, after sliding as much as 1,056 points to 81,124.45 earlier in the session. The Nifty 50 followed suit, climbing 68 points, or 0.3%, to an intraday high of 25,300.95, recovering from a low of 24,919.80 that briefly dragged the index below the psychologically important 25,000 level.The rebound came after a bruising morning selloff that extended losses into a third straight session, driven by a toxic mix of global risk aversion, persistent foreign fund outflows, a sliding rupee and patchy domestic earnings. At its worst, the fall erased about Rs 6 lakh crore in market capitalisation, underscoring the fragility of investor sentiment.Market participants attributed the turnaround largely to selective buying in quality names after the recent correction, rather than any meaningful shift in the broader risk environment.“It seems like bargain hunting in the quality stocks after the recent decline, but participants shouldn't read much into this and wait for the closing and sustainability of the long term moving average i.e. 200 DEMA i.e. around 25,150, for clarity,” said Ajit Mishra, SVP, Research at Religare Broking.Live Events""The market was falling for last few days due to rising geopolitical tensions, which was exacerbated by Trump's Greenland bid and today’s drawdown appears to have been primarily driven by margin calls impacting highly leveraged positions, which accelerated forced unwinding across the market,"" said Sunny Agrawal, Head of Fundamental Research at SBI Securities, adding that once those positions",2026-01-22,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/from-bloodbath-to-bounce-sensex-erases-1000-point-shock-nifty-above-25250-as-bargain-hunters-step-in/articleshow/126951532.cms,neutral,economictimes,,,,1

FII shorts highest since March 2025. How to trade Nifty now,"Foreign institutional investors have built their largest index futures short positions since March 2025, pushing the long–short ratio close to record lows. However, a sharp rise in index futures longs on a non-expiry day signals potential short covering ahead, setting the stage for heightened volatility and tactical trading opportunities in the January series.Edited excerpts from a chat with Anand James, Chief Market Strategist, Geojit Investments:Nifty ended the week flat, but on Monday, the market would react to earnings of heavyweights like RIL, HDFC Bank and ICICI Bank. What are the key levels to watch out for?Our eyes are on 26,020 as the near-term objective, encouraged by a parallel consolidation bias since 9th January, apparently putting a pause to the downside spree that has been on since the start of this year. However, the systematic uptick in VIX, albeit small, suggests that volatility expectations are rising, and hence it would be prudent to factor in wild swings. This would also mean that we will have to acknowledge a fair potential for falls to the 200-day SMA, now at 25,090, should we see slippage past 25,600.Nifty Bank outperformed during the week, but PSU banks fared even better. Which side of the trade would you be on in the week ahead?Between Nifty Bank and Nifty PSU Bank indices, the latter has the better momentum, having closed at a new record peak for the second consecutive day. This would also mean that should there be a broad market negativity, the PSU Bank Index could slip faster. That said, both indices are positioned for more upside, unless the quarterly result surprises weigh index biggies down.Live EventsFIIs are building short positions in Nifty futures. How worrisome is it for the January series?At 2,13,900 contracts, FIIs are holding the highest index futures short positions since March 2025. Consequently, the long short ratio is at 9.3, not far from the record low. The reason why we have not hit a new record low for the ratio, despit",2026-01-22,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/fii-shorts-highest-since-march-2025-how-to-trade-nifty-now/articleshow/126637853.cms,neutral,economictimes,,,,1

Eternal Q3 Preview: Earnings set to grow 50% YoY; Blinkit losses persist,"Eternalis expected to post robust headline growth in the December quarter, largely supported byBlinkit’s transition to a first-party (1P) model and continued momentum in quick commerce. On average, five brokerages project consolidated revenue to surge 193% year-on-year in Q3, while profit after tax is estimated to rise 51% from the same period last year.Meanwhile, analysts caution that margin performance and ongoing losses in Blinkit and other newer businesses will remain key monitorables, even as the core food delivery segment shows steady signs of improvement.Food delivery: Growth moderates, margins inch upThe food delivery business is likely to record steady growth in Q3, albeit at a slower pace than in previous quarters. Nuvama estimates net order value for food delivery to rise 2.2% quarter-on-quarter and 14.1% year-on-year, indicating stable demand but limited acceleration.Motilal Oswal expects order value for food delivery to grow around 12% year-on-year, with take rates holding at about 21.5%. Kotak Equities projects 18% year-on-year growth in food delivery GMV.Live EventsOn profitability, brokerages foresee incremental gains. Nuvama expects adjusted EBITDA margin as a percentage of net order value at around 5.4%, while Motilal Oswal sees a 20 basis point sequential improvement to 5.5%.

Brokerages broadly project Blinkit’s net order value to rise around 14–15% sequentially and about 122–123% year-on-year, backed by rapid dark store expansion and higher order density.Kotak Equities estimates that Blinkit added approximately 284 dark stores during the quarter, bringing its total network to around 2,100 outl",2026-01-22,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/eternal-q3-preview-earnings-set-to-grow-50-yoy-blinkit-losses-persist/articleshow/126769544.cms,neutral,economictimes,,,,1

"HSBC, CLSA upgrade CreditAccess Grameen after strong Q3; stock zooms 10%. Check target price","Shares ofCreditAccess Grameenrallied as much as 10.5% to their day’s high of Rs 1,369 on the BSE on Wednesday after foreign brokerages HSBC and CLSA upgraded the stock to 'Buy' following its December quarter earnings.HSBC has assigned a target price of Rs 1,630, forecasting a 31% upside from the last closing price of Rs 1,240 per share on the BSE. The brokerage said the Q3FY26 performance was driven by margin expansion and a significant decline in provisions. HSBC expects a stronger performance in FY27 than what current guidance implies and has increased its FY26–FY28E EPS estimates by 7–13%.CLSA has pegged the target price at Rs 1,450, implying an upside of 17% from the current market levels, citing a sharp improvement in asset quality trends in its core microfinance portfolio. The brokerage highlighted the introduction of new products in retail finance and expects the non-MFI segment to account for more than 15% of the overall mix in FY26. CLSA also noted that the company is set to provide details of its redesigned business model and strategic direction in the next quarter.CreditAccess Q3 performance snapshotThe company’s net profit came in at Rs 252 crore, marking a massive increase of 153% from Rs 99.50 crore reported in the corresponding quarter of the previous year, the company said in a regulatory filing. This translates into a return on assets of 3.5% and a return on equity of 13.8%. The decline in new PAR accretion led to a 54.4% YoY reduction in credit costs to Rs 342.6 crore.Assets under management increased 7.1% year-on-year to Rs 26,566 crore from Rs 24,810 crore. Disbursements also recorded healthy growth, rising 13.4% YoY to Rs 5,767 crore from Rs 5,085 crore.

"Watch out! Gold, silver on MCX, ETFs trading at premium to international rates","Precious metals gold and silver are trading at abnormally high premiums over international benchmarks in India as traders, whether on MCX or those dealing in ETFs, are acting on rumours around the possibility of a potential customs duty hike in the upcoming Union Budget to be presented in the Parliament on February 1.The premium spike, exceeding Rs 30,000 per kg for silver and 3-4% for gold, marks a sharp departure from the typical minimal spread between Multi Commodity Exchange (MCX) and COMEX prices, signaling widespread market anxiety about possible policy action.""The premium in the Indian market is abnormally high this time because the market is expecting there may be a duty hike in the Budget. That's why the premium is increasing,"" Manoj Kumar Jain, Director and Head of Commodity and Currency Research atPrithviFinmart told ET.The surge comes against the backdrop of dramatic price movements, with MCX gold February futures trading around 5% higher at Rs 1,57,750 by 5 pm, while silver March futures jumped 3% to Rs 3,33,672. Gold ETFs showed even sharper gains—Gold BeES ETF shot up 7.6%, Zerodha Gold ETF soared 9.6% higher, and Nippon India Silver ETF climbed 4.8%.The abnormal premium is creating technical dislocations in arbitrage trades. ""International traders also do arbitrage between COMEX and MCX. Normally international traders are long on COMEX, short on MCX. Now as the price is going up, the spread is increasing and they are incurring losses. So there is a technical reason as well for this premium,"" Jain explained.Live EventsThe speculation centers on whether the government might roll back its July 2024 decision to slash customs duty on gold and silver from 15% to 6%, a move initially designed to support the gems and jewellery sector and curb smuggling.""Now rising gold prices are directly impacting rupee depreciation. The government may hike duty to protect rupee depreciation,"" Jain added, pointing to the potential policy rationale behind market fears.On Wed",2026-01-22,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/watch-out-gold-silver-on-mcx-etfs-trading-at-premium-to-international-rates/articleshow/126989236.cms,neutral,economictimes,,,,1

Stock Market Holiday? NSE to remain open on January 15 during Maharashtra civic polls,"Indian stock exchange NSE will remain open for regular trading on January 15 even though Maharashtra has declared a public holiday for civic polls across several big cities in the state.NSE in a circular said January 15 will be a settlement holiday on this date. This means, there will be no settlement for T+0 settlement on January 15. While trading activity may continue as per the exchange timetable, clearing and settlement obligations for that specific T+0 cycle will not be processed on that day.Because of the settlement holiday, the settlement schedule for T+1 trades has also been adjusted. As per the revised schedule, trades done on January 14 will now be settled on January 16. For trades executed on January 15, settlement will also take place on January 16.Settlement holidays are typically declared during elections or major public events when banking and clearing operations are affected. Because January 15 is a public holiday in the state, most of the banks would remain closed on the date.For retail investors, the key takeaway is that trading is not impacted, but the credit of shares or funds may be delayed by a day around January 15 due to the settlement holiday.Live EventsStock market holidays in 2026Indian stock exchanges will remain shut for 15 days in 2026. The holiday calendar begins with Republic Day on January 26 and covers a mix of major national and religious occasions. Key closures in the first half of the year include Holi on March 3, Ram Navami on March 26, Mahavir Jayanti on March 31 and Good Friday on April 3. Markets will also remain closed on Ambedkar Jayanti on April 14, Maharashtra Day on May 1, and Bakri Id on May 28.In the latter half of the year, trading will be suspended on Muharram on June 26, Ganesh Chaturthi on September 14 and Gandhi Jayanti on October 2. This will be followed by Dussehra on October 20, Diwali Balipratipada on November 10, and Guru Nanak Jayanti on November 24.

Gandhar Oil Refinery shares zoom 17% on strong volumes amid US-Venezuela tensions,"Shares ofGandhar Oil Refinery(India) soared 17% to hit an intraday high of Rs 177.60 on the BSE on Monday, driven by heavy trade volumes and potentially due to the risinggeopolitical tensionsinvolving the US and Venezuela, a country with significant oil reserves.The stock was trading at Rs 173.50 around 1 pm, up 14.26% from its previous close of Rs 151.85.The surge in price was accompanied by a sharp spike intrading volumes, with over 21 lakh shares changing hands compared to the two-week average of just 20,000 shares. The turnover stood at Rs 36.5 crore, highlighting heightened investor interest in the counter.The stock traded firmly within its price band of Rs 121.50 to Rs 182.20 for the day and remains comfortably above its 52-week low of Rs 120.60, though still below its 52-week high of Rs 222.80.The company’smarket capitalisationstood at Rs 1,698 crore.Live EventsGandhar Oil Refinery, incorporated in 1992, is a key player in thewhite oilssegment, serving both consumer and healthcare end-user industries. It is one of the top five global manufacturers of white oils and commands a 26.5% market share in India and 9.6% globally.While the company did not issue any exchange filing or announcement to trigger the sharp rally, market participants may have speculated that rising tensions between the US and Venezuela, a major oil-producing nation, may have pushed investors to turn bullish on domestic oil-related counters, with Gandhar Oil being one of the key beneficiaries due to its niche positioning and scale in the white oil segment.The developments come at a time when global crude markets are closely watching potential supply disruptions, making oil-linked plays on the domestic bourses increasingly attractive.Also read:BEL, HAL, other defence stocks jump up to 5% after US raids Venezuela(Disclaimer: Recommendations, suggestions, views and opinions given by the experts are their own.

Indian banks seen churning stronger Q3 profits after a weak first half. Brokers pick 10 stocks to buy,"Indian banks are heading into the December quarter earnings season with a clearer sense of direction after a choppy first half of FY26. Brokerages tracking the sector broadly agree on three clear trends for Q3 that credit growth remains healthy, margin pressure is easing for now, and asset quality is no longer deteriorating. Together, these factors are expected to drive a year-on-year improvement in profitability, even if sequential gains remain modest.Across brokerage reports of Systematix,YES Securities, and Elara Capital, 10 banking stocks emerged as consistent picks or preferred names for the quarter ahead:ICICI Bank,Axis Bank,HDFC Bank,Kotak Mahindra Bank, State Bank of India,Bank of Baroda,Indian Bank, Ujjivan Small Finance Bank, DCB Bank and City Union Bank.Credit growth holds firm across segmentsOne of the strongest signals heading into Q3 is the durability of loan growth. RBI data shows banking system advances growing nearly 12% year-on-year and 4.5% quarter-on-quarter as of mid-December 2025. Growth has improved across key segments, especially micro and small enterprises, services and retail loans.Industrial credit growth has picked up meaningfully, driven by small businesses, while services lending has also accelerated. Retail credit remains steady, with vehicle loans and personal loans showing faster growth. At the same time, credit card lending has slowed further, pointing to a gradual cooling in unsecured retail stress.Live EventsSystematix Equities estimates loan growth of about 11.6% year-on-year for its coverage universe in Q3. Banks such as HDFC Bank, Axis Bank, ICICI Bank, Bank of Baroda, Indian Bank andSBIare expected to grow faster than the sector average.JM Financial also expects credit growth momentum to strengthen, led by retail, MSME and services loans, with mid-sized banks and small finance banks showing relatively stronger sequential growth.Deposits lag, but liquidity stays manageableWhile loans are growing steadily, deposit growth continu",2026-01-22,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/indian-banks-seen-churning-stronger-q3-profits-after-a-weak-first-half-brokers-pick-10-stocks-to-buy/articleshow/126387347.cms,neutral,economictimes,,,,1

"D-St investors lose Rs 18.5 lakh crore in 6 days as Sensex slumps 2,900 pts, Nifty sinks 3%. What’s driving the selloff?","Indian equities extended their slump on Monday, with the Sensex and Nifty deepening a selloff that has erased nearly Rs 18.55 lakh crore in market value in six days and left investors grappling with fresh uncertainty at home and abroad.The BSE Sensex slumped over 700 points, to the day's low of 82,864, while the NSE Nifty 50 slid over 150 points, slipping below the 25,500 mark.From a closing high of 85,762.01 on Jan 2, the Sensex has shed more than 2,903 points, touching an intraday low of 82,864 on Monday. The Nifty has declined about 3.2% over the same period, hitting a low of 25,473.The declines come on the heels of the market’s worst weekly performance in more than three months, reflecting investor unease after an anticipated U.S. Supreme Court ruling on President Donald Trump’s tariffs failed to materialise, prolonging a policy overhang.The market capitalisation of all listed BSE companies has fallen by Rs 18.55 lakh crore in six days to Rs 462.68 lakh crore in six days.Live EventsWhy stock market is falling today? Here are 5 key factors weighing on Indian equities:1. Trump tariffs and the murky U.S.-India trade outlookAn elusive India-U.S. trade deal is blunting optimism around the domestic earnings season, with profit-taking persisting amid uncertainty over U.S. tariff policy, analysts said.“The market has turned distinctly weak, weighed down by a series of India-specific and global geopolitical events. The drama surrounding the US-India trade deal is getting murkier with strange remarks from the US administration. This is impacting the market,” said Dr. VK Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist at Geojit Investments.He added that global flashpoints are compounding the unease. “Geopolitical developments in Venezuela, the crisis in Iran and Trump’s threats regarding Greenland are also being viewed by the markets with concern. This has spiked the India volatility index India VIX indicating big volatility ahead.”According to Vijayakumar, the absence of clarity",2026-01-22,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/why-is-stock-market-falling-today-sensex-slides-2700-pts-in-6-days-nifty-sinks-3-rs-17-lakh-crore-wiped-out-in-6-days-whats-driving-the-selloff/articleshow/126475026.cms,neutral,economictimes,,,,1
Japan's Nikkei extends fall as rally loses steam,"Japan's Nikkei share ‍average fell for a second consecutive session on Friday as investors took a breather ⁠from a rally driven by hopes for morefiscal stimulus.The Nikkei slipped 0.32% to 53,936.17, while the broader Topix edged down 0.28% to 3,658.68. The two indexes rose ‌nearly 4% ‌this week following a report over the weekend that Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi might dissolve parliament ‌this month and call for a general election in February. The Liberal Democratic Party's secretary general confirmed the report on Wednesday.For the month, the Nikkei and the Topix gained more than 7% so far.""The market needed to pause after the sharp gains this week. Today's declines are a small adjustment to reflect that sentiment... The ‌overall view ‍has not changed,"" saidKazunori Tatebe, chief strategist at ‍Daiwa Asset Management.""The market priced in the best ‌political scenario where the LDP boosts seats at the election and Takaichi gets backing for spending plans that the stock market has high expectations on.""Live EventsBut there were some uncertainties over the election outcome, such as the discrepancy between the support rate for Takaichi and the LDP, said Tatebe. On Thursday, the main opposition ‍Constitutional Democratic Party of Japan and Komeito agreed to form a new political party in an attempt to present ‍a united front ⁠against the LDP.Among ⁠individual stocks, Uniqlo owner Fast Retailing fell 2.12% to drag down the Nikkei the most.

Banks' credit-to-deposit ratio hits record 81.75% as mobilisation lags,"Mumbai:Indian banks' credit-to-deposit (CD) ratio climbed to an all-time high of 81.75% as of December 31, indicating pressure on lenders to shore up deposits amid risingloan demand,Reserve Bank of Indiadata showed.The ratio means banks lent ₹81.75 for every ₹100 of deposits mobilised. While the RBI does not prescribe a cap, it has urged lenders to maintain adequate liquidity buffers to meet unexpected withdrawals.Banks have asked the RBI to include bond borrowings in the CD ratio calculation, which would help bring it below 80%. Currently, only deposits and certificates of deposit are considered for computing the ratio.Typically, out of every ₹100 in deposits, banks set aside ₹3 for cash reserve requirements, ₹18 for statutory reserves and hold ₹3-5 in additional government securities to comply with liquidity coverage rules. After these allocations, the amount available for lending works out to ₹75-76.Live EventsThe elevated CD ratio reflects challenges in mobilising deposits as investors seek higher returns elsewhere.Small savings schemescurrently offer 7.10% for three-year deposits, compared with 6.40-6.50% offered by banks.The challenge intensified after the RBI cut its policy rate by 125 basis points since February 2025, prompting lenders to reduce deposit rates. The weighted average rate on outstanding term deposits fell to 6.73%, the lowest since September 2023, while fresh deposits averaged 5.59%, the lowest since October 2022.Deposit mobilisationhas lagged credit growth. Bank credit rose 11.4% in 2025, while deposits grew 10.1%. Outstanding deposits were ₹248.5 lakh crore, while credit was ₹202 lakh crore as of December 31.""To overcome this challenge, banks will have to explore alternative sources such as bond issuance to finance credit growth,"" said Saurabh Bhalerao, associate director and head of BFSI Research atCare Ratings. ""The pace of investments in government securities has slowed, implying banks are deploying funds for lending,"" he added.Fresh inves",2026-01-22,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/banks-credit-to-deposit-ratio-hits-record-81-75-as-mobilisation-lags/articleshow/126555068.cms,neutral,economictimes,,,,1

HDFC Bank shares tank 6% in 5 straight sessions. Should investors buy this dip?,"Shares of India’s largest private-sector lender,HDFC Bank, declined as much as 1% to an intraday low of Rs 938 on Friday, January 9, extending their losing streak to a straight fifth session. The stock has shed 6% over this period, ahead of the bank’s third-quarter earnings announcement scheduled for January 17.What should investors do?“HDFC Bank stock is showing a clear bearish structure on the daily chart, with price trading below all key EMAs (20, 50, 100, and 200), indicating weakness across all timeframes,” Aakash Shah, Technical Research Analyst at Choice Equity Broking told ETMarkets.The breakdown from the Rs 1,000–1,020 resistance zone has triggered strong selling pressure, leading to lower highs and lower lows. Bearish candles supported by higher volumes point toward distribution rather than a healthy correction.Momentum remains weak, with RSI below the mid-line, signaling lack of bullish strength. The Rs 940-Rs 935 zone is acting as immediate support; a break below could lead to further downside toward Rs 900–Rs 885. Overall bias remains bearish unless key EMAs are reclaimed, Aakash added.Live EventsEchoing the view, Vatsal Bhuva of LKP Securities said: The RSI has entered a bearish crossover and is placed near 26, indicating an oversold condition. Immediate support is seen in the Rs 935–940 zone, from where a short-term recovery cannot be ruled out.”However, failure to hold this support may lead to further downside towards Rs 900, aligning with the 100 EMA on the weekly chart. As long as the stock trades below the 200 EMA, selling pressure may persist, with Rs 965 acting as key resistance.What could happen in Q3?December quarter performance points to steady balance-sheet expansion, with brokerages flagging a mixed near-term outlook on margins amid moderating yields, even as asset quality and cost discipline remain supportive.Management has indicated that most of the asset-side repricing is now behind, and NIMs are expected to benefit from the downward rep",2026-01-22,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/hdfc-bank-shares-tank-6-in-5-straight-sessions-should-investors-buy-this-dip/articleshow/126429277.cms,neutral,economictimes,,,,1

"MF Picks: 13 smallcap stocks with strong profit margins rally up to 163%, 5 turn multibaggers","When mutual funds quietly increase their exposure to fundamentally strong companies, it often sends a signal worth tracking. We set out to follow this smart-money trail. To do so, we screened BSE small-cap companies that reported strong year-on-year sales and profit growth of over 10% in the September quarter, while sustaining healthy profit margins above 10%. We further narrowed the list to companies that saw a rise in mutual fund shareholding during the September quarter compared with the previous quarter, excluding banking and financial stocks.Applying these criteria to the BSE small-cap universe resulted in a pool of around 74 stocks. We then layered in price performance filters, which showed that about 47 of these stocks have already generated double-digit returns in FY26. From this subset, we identified 13 standout performers that have delivered price returns ranging between 50% and 162% in FY26 so far, with five stocks emerging as multibaggers. (Data Source: ACE Equity) During FY26, the share price jumped 163%, climbing from Rs 318 to Rs 836. The company posted a strong profit margin of 17.1% in the September quarter, with mutual funds holding a 3.84% stake at the same time. In FY26, the stock rallied 125%, moving up from Rs 154 to Rs 347. It delivered a healthy 12.4% profit margin in the September quarter, while mutual fund ownership stood at 0.04%. The stock recorded a 107% surge in FY26, rising from Rs 1,062 to Rs 2,198. The company reported an impressive 53.2% profit margin for the September quarter, and mutual funds held a sizable 37.34% stake. In FY26, shares advanced 105%, increasing from Rs 472 to Rs 968. The September quarter saw a robust profit margin of 31.7%, with mutual fund participation at 0.29%. The stock gained 103% in FY26, moving from Rs 901 to Rs 1,830. It posted a solid 17.9% profit margin in the September quarter, while mutual funds owned 24.04% of the company. During FY26, the stock rose 85%, climbing from Rs 302 to Rs 560.

LKP Finance: Multibagger stock with 400% return in last one year announces 4:1 bonus issue,"LKP Financeon Monday said its board approved a bonus issue of shares in the proportion of 4-to-1. This means, investors holding one LKP Finance share as on record date will get additional 4 shares as bonus. The stock has surged 408% over the last 12 months and is up 116% in the past six months, reflecting strong investor interest in the company.At its latest board meeting, LKP Finance approved an increase in its authorised share capital from Rs 30 crore to Rs 110 crore, subject to shareholder approval. The board also cleared the issuance of bonus equity shares in the ratio of 4:1, meaning shareholders will receive four new equity shares for every one share held as on the record date. The bonus shares will be issued by capitalising the company’s securities premium account as at December 31.The company said the bonus shares are expected to be credited or dispatched within two months of the board meeting, on or before March 19, subject to shareholder approvals and regulatory clearances.LKPFinance is part of the Mumbai-basedLKP Group, a diversified financial services group with interests spanning broking, capital markets, investment banking, financing and advisory services. The company operates as a non-banking financial company (NBFC), focusing on lending and investment activities, and also benefits from the broader group’s presence in equity broking and market intermediation.Over the past year, renewed interest in financial stocks, improving balance sheet visibility and expectations of better capital market activity have driven a re-rating in several smaller finance companies, including LKP Finance.Live EventsA bonus issue is a way for companies to reward shareholders by converting accumulated reserves into share capital.

Lodha Developers shares rise 2% after strong Q3FY26 operating performance,"Lodha Developers sharesgained over 2% to their day's high of Rs 1,138 on Wednesday, January 7, after the real estate major reported strong operating performance for the December quarter.On Tuesday, Lodha Developers announced a 25% year-on-year rise in sales bookings to Rs 5,620 crore in Q3FY26, compared with Rs 4,510 crore in the same quarter last year.

Management highlighted that sustained sales momentum and a strong pipeline of launches in the March quarter are expected to help the company meet its full-year pre-sales guidance of Rs 210 billion.Collections for the quarter stood at Rs 35.6 billion, lower than Q3FY25 due to one-time inflows from large land and office transactions in the year-ago period.

"Morgan Stanley starts Meesho coverage with equal-weight; flags full valuation. Check target, upside potential","International brokerage Morgan Stanley has initiated coverage on newly listedMeeshowith an Equal-weight rating and a target price of Rs 169 per share, citing full valuations following the stock’s strong post-listing run-up. The target price suggests an upside of about 3% from current levels.The brokerage said valuations look full as Meesho’s advertising business remains at an early stage of monetisation, while the company continues to focus on rapid user expansion. Consequently, Morgan Stanley expects steady-state profitability to be a few years away.The brokerage believes investors are likely to value the business either by discounting FY31 adjusted EBITDA margins back to the present or by applying an EV toNMV multipleon FY28 estimates, similar to the EV to revenue approach used for offline retail. On its estimates, Meesho is currently trading at 1.14x FY28 EV to NMV, which it views as fair given its steady-state margin expectation of 3.8% of NMV. The price target of Rs 169 implies a multiple of about 1.2x FY28 EV to NMV, at a modest discount to Blinkit’s estimated multiple of around 1.4%. Within Morgan Stanley’s internet coverage universe, Meesho ranks in the middle of its preference list.What do analysts like?Meesho has built significant scale in the value e-commerce segment since its inception in 2015. The platform had about 234 million annual transacting users and over 700,000 sellers as of September 2025, operating at an average order value of around US$3. It offers a wide product assortment, with nearly 153.72 million daily active listings, supported by a hyper-personalised product feed. Morgan Stanley noted that 74.57% of placed orders were either generated through these feeds or driven by platform recommendations. The company also operates an asset-light marketplace model, which supports strong capital efficiency. The brokerage believes Meesho faces limited competition in the value commerce segment it operates in.Live EventsMeesho is positioned as a themati",2026-01-22,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/morgan-stanley-starts-meesho-coverage-with-equal-weight-flags-full-valuation-check-target-upside-potential/articleshow/126545515.cms,neutral,economictimes,,,,1

"Retail equity trading slows as SIPs, commodities hit new highs in December","India’s capital markets ended calendar year 2025 on a mixed note, with divergent trends across equity, mutual fund and commodity segments. While retail trading activity in equities showed a noticeable decline, investments through systematic investment plans (SIPs) and commodity market volumes surged to record levels.This contrasting pattern reflects evolving investor behaviour and participation dynamics heading into the new year.According to the latest report by Motilal Oswal, December saw cash and F&O activity decline sequentially, even as SIP flows scaled new highs and commodity trading rose to fresh peaks.The brokerage noted that a stable trajectory inmutual fund flowsand rising retail participation in commodities will bode well for asset management companies and support the performance of market intermediaries.Retail trading activity sees sequential declineMotilal Oswal reported that total equity Average Daily Turnover (ADTO) for December 2025 was flat month-on-month (MoM) at Rs 473.1 trillion. However, underlying components showed weakening trends:Live EventsCash segment ADTO fell 10% MoM to Rs 1.01 trillion.Option premium ADTO dropped 8% MoM to Rs 679 billion.Retail cash ADTO declined 6% MoM to Rs 375 billion.Retail futures and premium ADTO saw an 11% MoM dip to Rs 580 billion.In terms of market share, NSE continued to dominate the cash segment with a 93% share. In the F&O space, BSE’s notional turnover market share stood at 42.6% in December, down from 43.5% in November, while its premium turnover share rose to 27.7% from 25.9%.SIP inflows scale new peaks, AUM stableEven as equity trading softened, SIP flows touched a new record of Rs 310 billion in December 2025, compared with Rs 294 billion in November. The monthly average assets under management (MAAUM) for the mutual fund industry remained stable at Rs 82 trillion, marking an 18% year-on-year rise.Equity MAAUM also held steady at Rs 35.5 trillion, with Motilal Oswal observing that “stable mutual fund flow",2026-01-22,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/retail-equity-trading-slows-as-sips-commodities-hit-new-highs-in-december/articleshow/126503318.cms,neutral,economictimes,,,,1

"Kalyan Jewellers shares tank 14%, fall for 9th consecutive session. Should investors exit?","Shares ofKalyan Jewellerstumbled as much as 14% to their day’s low of Rs 390 on the BSE on Wednesday, continuing its bearish run on Dalal Street for a 9th consecutive session. With today’s fall, the counter is down 25% over the same period. In the first 14 sessions in 2026, the stock has ended in the green only three times.The bearish run coincides with gold prices surging to fresh record highs of nearly Rs 1.6 lakh per 10 grams. When gold prices rise sharply, jewellery becomes more expensive, leading to postponement of purchases. Mass and mid-market consumers tend to cut back, causing a decline in volume growth, particularly for plain gold jewellery.While volumes may soften, revenues can still grow because of higher gold prices. However, this growth is price-led rather than demand-led. For jewellery makers, this often results in higher ticket sizes but fewer units sold.Last week, the company appointed Radhika Ramani and C.R. Rajagopal as Additional Directors in the capacity of Non-Executive and Independent Directors. Both appointments are for a term of five consecutive years. The board said the appointments are in line with the company’s ongoing focus on strengthening corporate governance, enhancing independent oversight and driving long-term value creation.Technical view“On the daily chart, price has broken decisively below all key moving averages (20, 50, 100 & 200 EMA), confirming a well-established downtrend. The EMAs are stacked bearishly and sloping downward, indicating continued selling pressure and absence of short-term trend support,” Aakash Shah, Technical Research Analyst at Choice Equity Broking, said.Live EventsThe latest breakdown candle is a large bearish candle accompanied by expanded volume, suggesting panic selling or aggressive unwinding. The lack of any immediate fundamental trigger further reinforces the technical nature of this move, pointing toward strong institutional selling activity.Immediate support is placed in the Rs 390–380 zone, where",2026-01-22,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/kalyan-jewellers-shares-tank-14-fall-for-9th-consecutive-session-should-investors-exit/articleshow/126943018.cms,neutral,economictimes,,,,1

Market participants seek equity tax relief ahead of Budget,"Market participants have urged the government to easecapital market taxation, including a higher exemption limit on long-term capital gains, ahead of the Union Budget for 2026-27.They also suggested that the government avoid further increases in transaction taxes.The Union Budget will be presented by Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman on February 1.Market stakeholders also demanded enhancement of the tax-free exemption limit on long-term capital gains (LTCG) from equity investments to provide greater relief to retail and long-term investors.In its budget wishlist,JM FinancialServices recommended that the government should raise the tax-free exemption limit for equity LTCG from Rs 1.25 lakh to Rs 2 lakh.Live EventsThe firm also sought to standardise the definition of ""long term"" to 12 months across all asset classes, including equity, debt, gold and real estate, to reduce complexity and improve tax clarity.Additionally, it called for allowing capital losses to be set off against income under other heads.Market participants have also cautioned against any further increase in transaction-related taxes.Dhiraj Relli, Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer ofHDFC Securities, said stakeholders have proposed keeping theSecurities Transaction Tax(STT) on cash equity trades lower than that on derivatives to encourage long-term investing over speculative trading.He also suggested taxing only the profit component of share buybacks and aligning dividend tax rates for domestic investors with those applicable to non-resident Indians (NRIs).Tejas Khoday, Chief Executive Officer ofFYERS, said the government should refrain from raising STT any further.He added that reducing both long-term and short-term capital gains tax to 10 per cent would significantly boost retail investor participation.Khoday also expressed hope that import duties on gold and silver are not increased further, as these assets remain important hedging instruments against equity market volatility and rupee",2026-01-22,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/market-participants-seek-equity-tax-relief-ahead-of-budget/articleshow/126639991.cms,neutral,economictimes,,,,1

"Sensex falls over 200 points led by FMCG, IT stocks; Nifty below 25,750","After opening on a positive note, Indian equities slipped into the red territory on Tuesday. The gains from the optimism surrounding U.S. trade developments were reversed by the losses in FMCG and IT stocks.By 9:30 a.m., the Sensex had reversed course, falling 200 points, or 0.23%, to 83678.17, while the Nifty 50 went past the 25,700 level, as investors turned cautious after the opening uptick.On the 30-stock Sensex, gains were led byEternal,Tech Mahindra,State Bank of India, Bharat Electronics,HDFC BankandTitan, with the shares advancing between 0.4% and 3%.IT stocks outperformed, with the index rising 0.6%.Tata Consultancy Servicesedged up 0.2% andHCL Technologiesclimbed 1% after both companies reported a modest revenue beat for the December quarter.The advance was broad-based, with small-cap and mid-cap indices each adding about 0.4%.Live EventsIn the previous session, both the Sensex and the Nifty rose roughly 0.4% as expectations built that India-U.S. trade negotiations could regain momentum, following comments from a U.S. envoy indicating the two sides were set to discuss trade issues in a call later in the day.Expert viewsGeopolitical developments and President Trump’s comments and actions will continue to influence markets, said Dr. VK Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist at Geojit Investments, adding that ""Trump’s weaponisation of tariffs has already impacted global trade and particularly countries which have been targeted with penal tariffs. Trump’s latest declaration that the US will impose 25% tariffs on countries doing trade with Iran clearly sends out the message that this policy of weaponisation of tariffs will continue.""""Apart from targeting other countries, Trump is also targeting those who don’t toe his line at home.

"Asian shares rise on valuations, dollar declines","Asian shares climbed to near a record, buoyed by optimism over earnings and regional economic growth as investors broadened their focus beyond US markets.TheMSCI Asia Pacific Indexadvanced 0.9% on Wednesday for a second day of gains. Asian shares have outpaced the S&P 500 this year, even as the US benchmark rose 0.2% to close at a record high. Equity-index futures for US stocks declined 0.2% in early Asian trading.Much of the early action was in Japan, where stock gauges jumped after returning from a holiday. The yen gained as much as 0.2% to 157.90 per dollar after Finance Minister Satsuki Katayama said she told US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent that she’s concerned about one-way yen moves. Japanese government bond yields surged amid speculation that Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi might dissolve the parliament as soon as next month.Asian shares, relatively cheaper after three years of gains, face key risks this week fromUS inflation dataand a possible Supreme Court ruling on President Donald Trump’s tariffs. The momentum in stocks suggested investors are looking beyond the US, where renewed attacks by the Trump administration on the Federal Reserve have raised concerns over central-bank independence.“Non-US assets such as European and Asian equities are likely to look more favorable, especially due to cheaper valuations and as US foreign policy becomes more unpredictable,” said David Chao, global market strategist at Invesco Asset Management, which oversees more than $2 trillion.Live EventsAsian shares are cheaper compared with US benchmarks. The MSCI Asia Pacific index trades at about 15 times earnings, compared with about 22 times for the S&P 500 and 25 times for the Nasdaq 100, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.On Sunday, Fed Chair Jerome Powell said the central bank had been served grand jury subpoenas from the Justice Department threatening a criminal indictment.

"Why today’s market holiday sparked a Street debate: Shankar Sharma, Nithin Kamath, Samir Arora react","India’s stock markets going dark for a local municipal election has triggered an unusually sharp debate among the country’s most influential market voices, reopening an uncomfortable question: how global is India’s stock market mindset, really?The BSE and NSE remained shut on Monday (January 15) due to the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) elections, a decision that immediately drew scrutiny because of the exchanges’ growing international linkages andforeign investor participation. While trading desks stayed idle, the commentary on X was anything but.ZerodhaCo-founder and CEONithin Kamathset the tone with a pointed critique, framing the closure as a structural failure rather than a one-off inconvenience. “Indian stock exchanges are closed today for Mumbai's municipal elections,” Kamath wrote, calling the move “poor planning” and a “serious lack of appreciation for second-order effects.”Kamath went further, questioning the incentive framework behind such decisions. Quoting Charlie Munger, he said:“Show me the incentive, and I will show you the outcome.”According to Kamath, the holiday persists because “no one who matters has any incentive to oppose the market holiday,” adding that it underlines “how far we have to go beforeglobal investorstake us seriously.”That global-investor lens was echoed, albeit from a different angle, by Helios Capital’sSamir Arora. Arora pushed back on the idea that the holiday is inconsequential, raising questions around consistency and fairness for overseas participants.Live Events“So if it does not matter to anyone who does it matter to,” Arora wrote, warning against selective logic around trading days.I don't follow why this closure thing is so bad: three clear positives:1. Agar aaj market khula hota, F2s would have sold another few thousand crores2. Market being open on Feb 1, is also a good thing, because F2s are closed, and hence, they can't sell a few thousand crores…https://t.co/YYcxdG5nxq— Shankar Sharma (@1shankarsharma)Janu",2026-01-22,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/why-todays-market-holiday-sparked-a-street-debate-shankar-sharma-nithin-kamath-samir-arora-react/articleshow/126541520.cms,neutral,economictimes,,,,1

"Market Wrap: Sensex falls over 200 points, Nifty below 25,700 as U.S. tariff worries spur foreign outflows","Indian equities closed lower on Wednesday, with the Sensex and Nifty extending their slide as worries over potential U.S. tariffs and persistent foreign investor outflows outweighed gains in metal and banking stocks.The benchmark BSE Sensex slipped 245 points, or 0.29%, to end at 83,382.71, while the NSE Nifty 50 fell 66.7 points, or 0.26%, to 25,665.60. The decline marked the seventh loss in eight sessions for both indexes, reflecting fragile investor sentiment despite pockets of sectoral strength.Losses on the 30-stock Sensex were led byTata Consultancy Services,Asian Paints,Maruti Suzuki,Sun PharmaandHindustan Unilever, each sliding between 1.5% and 2%.Shares of state-owned lenders bucked the broader weakness, with the PSU bank index climbing 2.1% after strong earnings.Union Bank of Indiasurged 7.9% andIndian Overseas Bankrose 2.2% following higher quarterly profits.Still, declines in heavyweightHDFC Bank, down 1.3%, and IT bellwether Tata Consultancy Services, off 2.3%, weighed on the main indexes.Live EventsSeparately,Tata Elxsisank 5% after reporting a drop in quarterly profit.Expert viewsDomestic markets remained cautious amid lingering uncertainty over the India–US trade deal, with FIIs staying risk-averse, said Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Investments, adding that the restart of negotiations this week has instilled renewed hopes.""Metals led the rally as prices climbed on expectations of U.S. rate cuts, supported by softer inflation data and safe-haven demand amid geopolitical tensions. Broader markets performed well given selective buying in mid- and small-cap segments. Globally, equities traded mixed as investors awaited the U.S. December PPI and major bank earnings.

"Rs 9 lakh crore wipeout! Sensex crashes over 1,000 points, Nifty below 25,250. Here are 7 factors pulling the stock market lower","Indian equities ended sharply lower on Tuesday, as a late-morning selloff dragged benchmark indices to their lowest levels in three months. At the end of the session, the BSESensexdeclined 1,065.7 points or 1.28% to close at 82,180.47, while the NSENifty50 slipped lower by 353 points or 1.38%, settling at 25,232.50.The decline marked a second straight session of losses, reflecting the fragility of sentiment amid mixed corporate earnings, persistent foreign fund outflows and lingering global trade uncertainty.The market capitalisation of all listed companies on the BSE fell by Rs 9.46 lakh crore to Rs 455.7 lakh crore.Here are the key factors why stock market is down today:1. IT stocks drag benchmarks lowerInformation technology shares bore the brunt of the selloff, pushing Indian equity benchmarks to their lowest levels in over two months. The Nifty IT index slid 2.1%, emerging as the worst-performing sector of the day, with all its constituents trading in the red.Live EventsWipro fell nearly 3%, extending Monday’s decline after the company flagged a weaker-than-expected outlook for the fourth quarter. LTIMindtree tumbled 7% after reporting a drop in quarterly profit, citing a one-off impact from newly enacted labour codes.The tepid start to the earnings season has raised fresh concerns about the pace of corporate profit recovery, particularly within export-oriented sectors such as IT.“An area of concern is that early Q3 results do not indicate a recovery in earnings growth. This is likely to change when the results of auto companies start flowing in since this sector has done well in Q3 and it is heartening that the growth momentum is continuing in the sector,” said Dr. VK Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist at Geojit Investments.2.

"Rs 3 lakh crore wipeout! Sensex sheds over 900 pts from day’s peak, Nifty sinks 1%.  5 factors behind market decline","Indian stocks ended lower on Tuesday, after staging a brief morning flourish, only to unravel just as quickly, leaving investors nursing sharp intraday losses and a renewed sense of unease. The BSE Sensex tumbled as much as 933 points from its day’s peak, while the Nifty 50 slid more than 1%, erasing Rs 2.6 lakh crore in market value as selling pressure intensified through the session.The Sensex, which touched an intraday high of 84,258.03, slipped to a low of 83,324.84. The Nifty fell from its peak of 25,899.80 to an intraday trough of 25,627.40. At the day's end, the Sensex was down 250 points, or 0.3%, to close at 83,627.69, while the Nifty declined 58 points, or 0.22%, to end the day at 25,732.30.The market capitalisation of all BSE-listed companies dropped to Rs 466.41 lakh crore.The day had begun on a hopeful note. Benchmarks opened modestly higher, extending a tentative rebound after snapping a five-day losing streak on Monday. Optimism around U.S. trade developments, along with steady early earnings from IT heavyweights Tata Consultancy Services and HCL Technologies, initially buoyed sentiment. But the relief rally proved fleeting.What are the key factors behind Tuesday’s market slide?Live Events1. Profit-taking in heavyweight stocksSelling pressure returned to index heavyweights, dragging the benchmarks lower. Reliance Industries slipped 2% after gaining 0.5% in the previous session. The oil-to-telecom conglomerate had already lost 7.4% last week after the company said it does not expect any Russian crude oil deliveries, keeping investors cautious.The IT pack also weighed on sentiment, with the sectoral index falling 0.4%. HCL Tech dropped 2%, while TCS edged down 0.1%. HCL Tech, despite posting a third-quarter revenue beat, narrowed its FY26 growth guidance to 4%–4.5% from 3%–5%. CLSA noted that the revised outlook indicated ""a fourth-quarter sequential decline on product business seasonality,” prompting investors to lock in gains after the recent rebound.",2026-01-22,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/why-is-stock-market-falling-today-sensex-sheds-933-points-from-days-peak-nifty-slumps-1-rs-3-lakh-crore-vanish-5-key-factors-behind-the-drop/articleshow/126500415.cms,neutral,economictimes,,,,1

Tata Elxsi shares shed 3% after Q3 profit declines 45% YoY,"Shares ofTata Elxsifell 3.2% in early trade to a day’s low of Rs 5,609.15 on the BSE on Wednesday, January 14, after the Bengaluru-based engineering research and development (ER&D) firm reported a 45.3% year-on-year decline innet profitfor the quarter ended December 31.The company posted a profit of Rs 1.09 billion ($12.1 million) for the quarter, sharply lower than the year-ago period, primarily due to a one-timeexceptional chargelinked to changes in India’slabour laws.Tata Elxsi took an exceptional charge of Rs 956.9 million during the quarter to provide for a one-time increase in employee benefit provisions following the implementation of the new labour codes, which came into effect in November.The revised labour regulations require companies to ensure wages account for at least 50% of the cost to company (CTC) and mandate a recalibration ofemployee benefitssuch as provident fund and gratuity based on the revised wage structure.Tata Elxsi was not alone in absorbing such costs. Other major IT firms, includingTCSand HCLTech, also recorded one-time charges of Rs 21.3 billion and Rs 9.6 billion, respectively, citing similar adjustments arising from the labour code overhaul.Live EventsDespite pressure on the bottom line, Tata Elxsi reported a marginal 1.5% year-on-year increase in revenue to Rs 9.53 billion for the quarter, supported by continued growth in its software development and services segment.Excluding the exceptional item and taxes, the company’s adjusted profit stood at Rs 2.42 billion, down 5.4% from the same period last year.Also read:Mukul Agrawal reshapes Rs 6,500-crore portfolio in Q3: Two new stocks, one exit.

"Unsecured loans, concentration of biz a risk to Indian banking","AState Bank of India(SBI) research report has pointed to the sharp increase inunsecured loansand continuing concentration of deposits and credit in top 10 districts as potential risks to the banking system after analysing data from the sector in the last two decades.The report also said that though bothbanking depositsand advances have expanded manifold over two decades, banks are dependent on a limited number of districts across the country for these key ingredients.“Sharp rise in unsecured lending raises risk sensitivity…Unsecured advances expanded from Rs 2 lakh crore to Rs 46.9 lakh crore, with share rising to 24.5% in FY25 from 17.7% in FY05 underscoring potentialcredit risk accumulation,” the SBI research team led by chief economic advisor Soumya Kanti Ghosh said.Since fiscal 2019, the share of unsecured loans in bank advances has been continuously above 20% withpublic sector banks(PSBs) accounting for half of the unsecured lending followed by private sector banks, the report said.Banking deposits have increased from Rs 18.4 lakh crore in fiscal 2005 to Rs 241.5 lakh crore in fiscal 2025 which advances have increased from Rs 11.5 lakh crore in fiscal 2005 to Rs 191.2 lakh crore during fiscal 2025. Faster growth in credit means that the credit deposit (CD) ratio for the sector has also increased from 69% in FY21 to 79% in FY25.Live EventsPublic Sector Banks’ (PSBs) market share loss has been arrested after showing a secular decline since FY 08, with trends now showing that PSBs are gradually reclaiming some lost ground indicating balance sheet repair and renewed lending appetite.However, regional disparity in both deposits and advances has continued. SBI research found that southern, western and northern regions dominate high CD ratios, while eastern and north-eastern regions lag, SBI’s research showed.“Some big States like Odisha, Bihar, Jharkhand & West Bengal…CD ratio is below 52%. There are 75 districts whose CD ratio is above 150 and 226 districts are ther",2026-01-22,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/banking-sector-bigger-but-rising-unsecured-loans-and-credit-concentration-pose-risks/articleshow/126494818.cms,neutral,economictimes,,,,1

Did Kotak Mahindra Bank shares really tank 80%? Here’s why investors do not need to panic,"Kotak Mahindra Bankshares saw a sharp decline of over 80% in early trade on Wednesday, hitting their day’s low of Rs 425.05 on the BSE. But before investors jump to conclusions, the dramatic fall in the stock price is not linked to the bank’s fundamentals.Instead, it's the result of a technical price adjustment as the stock tradedex-splitfollowing its recently announced 5:1 stock split.As per the corporate action, Kotak Mahindra Bank has subdivided each Rs 5 share into five shares of face value Rs 1. The record date for determining eligible shareholders was set for today, January 14, and the stock also began trading ex-split.This change effectively increases the number of outstanding shares in circulation by five times while reducing the face value per share. Accordingly, the share price gets adjusted downward to reflect the revised capital structure, without impacting the company’s market capitalisation or shareholder wealth.To break it down: if a shareholder owned 50 shares before the split, they would now hold 250 shares post-split. If the share was priced at Rs 1,800 before the split, it would now trade at approximately Rs 360 per share, leaving the total value of the investment unchanged.Live EventsAlso read:Mukul Agrawal reshapes Rs 6,500-crore portfolio in Q3: Two new stocks, one exit. Do you own?This is the second time Kotak Mahindra Bank has undertaken a stock split. The previous one was carried out in in September 2010, when the face value of shares was revised from Rs 10 to Rs 5.Like any corporate restructuring of this nature, today's price movement is mathematical and does not imply a deterioration in the bank’s financial health or performance.(Disclaimer: Recommendations, suggestions, views and opinions given by the experts are their own.

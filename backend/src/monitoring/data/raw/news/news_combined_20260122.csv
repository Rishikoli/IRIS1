"Mid-day Mood | Cooling volatility sparks market rally, India VIX sees steepest fall in 4 years","Benchmark Sensex and Nifty indices continued to trade in green on April 23 afternoon, led by gains in realty stocks. The rally helped ease market volatility as India VIX, which measures near-term volatility, fell sharply by 19 percent, last seen in May 2019. Around noon, the Sensex was up 263.09 points or 0.36 percent at 73,911.71, and the Nifty was up 83.80 points or 0.38 percent at 22,420.20.

Follow our live blog for all the market action Sectoral trend Barring Nifty Pharma, all sectors traded with gains on April 23 afternoon. Nifty Realty index was the top sectoral performer led by gains in DLF, Macrotech Developers, Godrej Properties, and Phoenix Mills. Fundamental view V K Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist, Geojit Financial Services said that external factors like the high bond yields in the US (the 10-year continues above 4.6 percent) and geopolitical concerns in the Middle East are not impacting the underlying bullish trend. ""FPI selling triggered by high US bond yields is neutralised by aggressive DII buying, putting the FPIs on the back foot,"" he said. Technical view Deven Mehata, Research Analyst at Choice Broking expects Nifty to find support at 22,300 followed by 22,200 and 22,150. On the higher side, 22,450 can be an immediate resistance, followed by 22,500 and 22,550, he said.

"Sensex, Nifty extend gains to 3rd day, Q4 results to guide stock-specific action","The benchmark Sensex and Nifty indices traded in the positive territory on April 23 morning backed by strong global cues. As corporate earnings season progresses, analysts believe stock-specific action will take place. However, they recommend caution, given the geopolitical uncertainties and the onset of general elections. Around morning, the Sensex was up 190.02 points or 0.26 percent at 73,838.64, and the Nifty was up 53.40 points or 0.24 percent at 22,389.80.

Meanwhile, the BSE Smallcap index outperformed benchmark as it surged 0.6 percent within the first hour of trade. However, VK Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist of Geojit Financial Services recommends investors to stick with fairly valued largecaps as high valuations plague broader markets. He believes that the underlying bullish tone of the markets will continue in the near-term as FPI selling may get neutralised by aggressive domestic buying. Deepak Jasani, Head of Retail Research, HDFC Securities forecasts Nifty to stay within 22,213-22,504 band in the near-term. ""We believe that Nifty has reversed its downward trend and is now expected to head higher,"" he said.
